sections:
# A list of supported sections.
# (Only one is present here, which is used as an example case to document everything.)
# Subthemes may override "sections" with a variable-length list.
# If this element is overridden, note that the entire "sections" list is overridden;
# it is not possible to override individual fields of a section and inherit the rest.
# The order is significant; it defines the order of the "supportedSections" model field,
# which can build a section menu.

  - name: "recent"
    # The section identifier.
    # Must be one of the valid values defined by org.ambraproject.wombat.controller.HomeController.SectionType.

    resultCount: 7
    # The number of articles to load into the model when this section is displayed.

    shuffle: null
    # If null (or omitted), don't shuffle results, but display them in the order defined in HomeController.
    #
    # If a non-null number, query for all articles published within that number of days. If there are more than
    # resultCount, select a random subset (of size == resultCount) and display them in a random order. Else, show a
    # number equal to resultCount, in chronological order, regardless of how old they are.
    #
    # Shuffling is supported (currently) only for "recent".
    # This must be null on any section for which shuffling is unsupported.

defaultSelection: "recent"
# The value must be either null or equal to the "name" value of one of the entries under "section".
# If null, the homepage takes no selection, and loads articles for every supported section into the model.
# If non-null, then the homepage has one selected section, and this is the default is none is queried for.
# This affects what is loaded into the model.
