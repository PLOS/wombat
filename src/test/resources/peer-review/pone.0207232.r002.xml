<p>[Response to Reviewers]</p><p>Title: Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison in different dose calculation grid sizes between Acuros XB and anisotropic analytical algorithm for prostate VMAT</p><p>Manuscript Number: PONE-D-18-18642</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a method to compare two commonly used algorithms, AAA and AXB, in treatment planning system for calculating the dose. The authors present the details of calculation results of using both algorithms under different grid sizes. The authors position the manuscript as a paper comparing the dose calculation results for the prostate cancer treatment with ERB, and the authors state that the AXB with 2 mm grid size is an endeavour worth undertaking for achieving the dose calculation accuracy and speed for prostate cancer treatment. However, the authors fail to make a clear and logical comparison for the results of two algorithms on their defined treatment plan. Overall, this manuscript reads like an experiment report with plain and simple analysis. Quite less insight and conclusion are made for the why and how the algorithm selection is made, instead, the authors spend a great deal of efforts to present and data in tables and figures. Moreover, the potential contradictions for reasoning the algorithm selection process are not considered. For instance, the authors state “As a result, the AAA predicted a higher dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could consequently estimate better target coverage than AXB.”, “Therefore, the calculated TCP of AAA was relatively higher than that of AXB, and the TCP differences among the algorithms showed a quite large variations (4.05%), which were statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.01).”, and “However, the HI of AAA was less than that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when using AXB.”, etc., these observations apparently show that AAA can have merits on some perspective that the authors introduced for evaluating its performance. So, does that mean that the better performance of AAA algorithm in these perspectives is not enough to consider applying it to this defined treatment study? If so, what is the premise of making this selection? The authors seem to need to design a well-defined evaluation structure to compare the performance of the algorithm, such as making a rank for different evaluation parameters as the authors introduced in the paper or weighting the performance of the algorithm on these parameters. The authors need to tell the potential readers what the premise of is comparing two algorithms, and why and how to make a reasonable and sound selection for them. Based on the presentation in this manuscript, however, the authors’ effort alone now is sufficient to justify publication as an article for recommending a dose calculation algorithm for the prostate cancer treatment.</p><p>By applying the two algorithms in the prostate treatment with ERB and comparing the performances of the selected algorithm from many perspectives is a good idea, will certainly be of interest to the readership of the Plos One. However, the authors fall short of their goal to provide a systematical and logical comparison of two algorithms. With substantial revisions, including attending to English grammar, a demonstration of the comparison standards, more sound algorithm selection rules, this article could be reconsidered for publication.</p><p>Some minor comments are made in the manuscript, the author may read them.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>Thank you for your thoughtful advice. We compared the dose calculation algorithms embedded in commercialized Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and the prerequisite of this study is that AXB has a more accurate dose calculation capability than AAA. Actually, we've already confirm the AXB and AAA performance in a rectangular acryl phantom with an air cavity by EBT3 film dosimetry in our previous studies. However, unlike the phantom, patients have various anatomy, and the treatment plan is also complicate depending on treatment technique, cancer type, and treatment site. Although AXB has been found to be more accurate in previous studies, due to those complexities in practice, dose calculation performance of both algorithms may be affected, as well as, also AXB dose calculation times are longer than AAA. Those are important clinical considerations in practice. Therefore, we selected the prostate cancer VMAT to investigate the appropriate algorithm for the clinics at a reasonable calculation time without significantly compromising accuracy. Next, we explained the meaning of the problematic sentence again.</p><p>“As a result, the AAA predicted a higher dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could consequently estimate better target coverage than AXB.”</p><p> Our response: As reported in previous studies, it has been confirmed that AAA overestimate the dose when compared to the measured values at the air cavity and air-material interface. In the prostate VMAT with endorectal balloon, PTV may contain a portion of the ballooned rectum, where AAA overestimates the dose. However, this portion did not actually contain much dose, because this was air. Therefore, when using the AAA, target coverage is better than AXB, but in fact it is overestimation.</p><p>“Therefore, the calculated TCP of AAA was relatively higher than that of AXB, and the TCP differences among the algorithms showed a quite large variations (4.05%), which were statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.01).”</p><p> Our response: We used EUD-based TCP models. As described above, AAA predicted doses with overestimated errors in the air inside PTV than for AXB. This leads to the increase in EUD and TCP of AAA compared with AXB.</p><p>“However, the HI of AAA was less than that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when using AXB.”</p><p> Our response: HI=  (D2- D98)/D50 , where 2, D98, and D50 represent the dose to 2%, 98%, and 50% volume for the PTV. High doses in PTV air caused the increase in D98, leading to the decrease in HI. However, the dose overestimated by AAA in PTV air is not accurate, therefore HI reduction of AAA did not guarantee the quality of a better treatment plan.</p><p>In addition, we have refined some English grammar and expressions and reflected all minor comments.</p><p>Another reminder: The corrected part can be identified as finding the yellow highlight marking in the manuscript. Thank you.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Grid size is an important parameter in treatment planning. The authors generated VMAT plans using anisotropic analytical algorithm and Acuros XB algorithm with different grid sizes, and compared the dosimetric and radiobiological parameters. The paper is manuscript is well-organized.</p><p>1. Page 4. Materials and methods. Can you provide the weight of these prostate patients? If possible, provide some information about the variations of inter-patient anatomy. Is the anatomy related with the performance of algorithms and grid sizes? Or your selected patients can be representatives for most clinical cases?</p><p>Our response:</p><p>The hypothesis that your anatomy can be related to the performance of algorithms and grid size has plenty of potential and is a good idea to improve the quality of this study. However, we did not observe the internal anatomy of the patient and it is difficult to analyze it. Therefore, future studies about the above contents will be planned and carried out. As your comments, we have presented the patient’s weight and related information in the manuscript. Patients who received VMAT for prostate cancer in our institution from April 2016 to April 2017 were randomly selected for analysis. Thank you. </p><p>2. line 169. Why did you select AXB1 as reference plans? Why not AAA1? Do you have specific reasons?</p><p>Our response:</p><p>In this study, we intended to investigate appropriate dose grid size and algorithm for clinical use. We have confirmed that AXB is superior to AAA in dose calculation in heterogeneous media through previous studies. In general, a finer dose grid is recommended in dose calculation for precise and accurate dose prediction. Therefore, the most accurate AXB1 were selected as reference and compared with other cases (AXB2, AXB3, AAA1, AAA3, AAA5). The manuscript was modified to express the above contents well. Thank you.</p><p> 3. Table 3. In V95%, Dmedian, Dmean, Dmin and CN, AXB3 is larger than AXB1 and AXB2. AAA1 is mostly larger than AAA3 and AAA5, which makes sense to me, longer calculation time generate more accurate results. Can you explain why AXB has different trends along the grid size, compared with AAA? Shorter time, but more accurate results (AXB3)?</p><p>Our response:</p><p>Actually, it is difficult to explain clearly the trend of AXB through the results of this study. Possible causes we guess is as follows. It may be derived from the material composition process of the AXB.  AXB required the material composition of voxels in the CT image by converting the Hounsfield unit to material derived mass density value. The automatic material composition is implemented with five biological materials divided according to the Hounsfield unit. When this material composition is performed on each dose voxel, the conversion of CT values might be affected by the size of the grid systematically. To clearly confirm this, well-designed studies should be conducted to assess this effect. This contents will included in discussion section.</p><p>The general consensus was that finer dose calculation grid would produce more accurate dose at the cost of calculation time. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimized number of dose grid at a reasonable calculation time without significantly compromising accuracy. Comparing with a reference (AXB1), AXB3 showed dose calculation accuracy without significantly compromising accuracy, while the accuracy of AAA is clearly reduced. In addition, dose calculation time of AXB3 (262 s) was comparable with that of AAA3 (245 s). Thank you.</p><p>4. It would be solid if you have dosimetric measurement or Monte Carlo calculation. Given so many plan calculation data, it is not easy to determine which one is more accurate.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We have already compared the dose calculation performance of AXB and AAA in the air cavity by using a phantom with the EBT film measurement in our previous studies. As a result, we confirmed that AXB had more similar results than AAA to film measurements in the air cavity and air-material interface in phantom. However, the influence of dose calculation grids and algorithms were not clearly identified in some clinical cases, and may affect differently the plan quality depending on treatment scheme (planning complexity, treatment techniques, cancer, degree of inhomogeneity, etc.). To clarify the above and to evaluate the clinical usefulness, we intended to extend previous study in prostate cancer VMAT. In this study, we designed plan study to analyze the effects of dose calculation algorithm and grid on prostate VMAT. </p><p> 5. Table 4. Too many data were listed. It would be better to present them in a more readable way, which also leads to a conclusion.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>Thank you for your comment. We decided to change the table to plotting with consideration for readable data representation.</p><p>6. Table 8. Why did you compared AAA 1mm with AXB 3 mm? Why not AAA 1 mm and AXB 1mm? Please explain this.</p><p>Our response: </p><p>The comparisons in Table 8 were as follows. </p><p> (AAA1 vs AXB1), (AAA3 vs AXB3) ; between algorithms with same dose grid</p><p> (AAA1 vs AAA3), (AAA1 vs AAA5) ; between AAAs with different dose grid</p><p> (AXB1 vs AXB2), (AXB1 vs AXB3) ; between AXBs with different dose grid</p><p>Since Table 8 was somewhat confusing, we described more details in the Table caption. Thank you.</p><p>7. Figure 2,3,4. It may confuse reader using so many colors in the subtraction image (AXB-AAA). The image resolution is not good enough. Please use a high quality figure or use two figure (without negative dose) to present AXB&gt;AAA and AXB</p><p>Our response:</p><p>Depending on your comment, we will limit the color of the figure and submit a high-quality figure. In PDF version, the figures showed poor in spite of high-quality of originals. You can download a high-quality figure by clicking the link in the upper right corner of the figure page of the PDF.  We uploaded the figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool to ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. Thank you.</p><p>Another reminder: The corrected part can be identified as finding the yellow highlight marking in the manuscript. Thank you.</p>
