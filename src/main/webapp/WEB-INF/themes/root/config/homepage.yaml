sections:
# A list of supported sections.
# (Only one is present here, which is used as an example case to document everything.)
# Subthemes may override "sections" with a variable-length list.
# If this element is overridden, note that the entire "sections" list is overridden;
# it is not possible to override individual fields of a section and inherit the rest.
# The order is significant; it defines the order of the "supportedSections" model field,
# which can build a section menu.

  - name: "recent"
    # The section identifier.
    # Must be one of the valid values defined by org.ambraproject.wombat.controller.HomeController.SectionType.

    resultCount: 7
    # The number of articles to load into the model when this section is displayed.

    shuffle: null
    # If null, don't shuffle results, but display them in the order defined in HomeController.
    # Else, must be a sequence of numbers. Pull articles from the last n days, where n is the first number in the
    # sequence. Iterate down the sequence until at the end or the number of articles is at least resultCount.
    # Then randomly reorder and display those.
    #
    # For example,
    #   {"sections": [ {"name": "recent", "resultCount": 5, "shuffle": [7, 14]} ]}
    # would mean to display a random selection of 5 articles from the past 7 days, or from the past 14 days
    # if fewer than 5 articles were published in the past 7 days.
    #
    # Shuffling is supported (currently) only for "recent".
    # This must be null on any section for which shuffling is supported.

defaultSelection: "recent"
# The value must be either null or equal to the "name" value of one of the entries under "section".
# If null, the homepage takes no selection, and loads articles for every supported section into the model.
# If non-null, then the homepage has one selected section, and this is the default is none is queried for.
# This affects what is loaded into the model.
