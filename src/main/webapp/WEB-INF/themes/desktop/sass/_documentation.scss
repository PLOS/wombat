I am a block quote: Diprotodon was the largest marsupial that ever lived. Diprotodon looked like a rhino without a horn. Its feet turned inwards like a wombat’s, giving it a pigeon-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet, so it may have been able to dig up roots to eat. Footprints of its hairy feet have been found, so we know it had fur like a horse rather than being bald like a rhino. Diprotodon is found in sites all over Australia, except in Tasmania.</p>

  <li>PR is the task of automatically detecting patterns in datasets and using them to characterize new data. PR is a form of machine learning, which itself is a field within artificial intelligence. Machine learning can be divided into two major groups. In <em>supervised learning</em>, or PR, a computer system is trained using a set of pre-defined classes, and then used to classify unknown objects based on the patterns detected in training. In <em>unsupervised learning</em> there are no classes defined a priori, and the computer system subdivides or clusters the data, usually by using a set of general rules. An example of supervised learning is automatic detection of protein localization, in which the computer system is trained using images of probes for known sub-cellular compartments <a href="#pcbi.1000974-Boland1">[10]</a>. An example of unsupervised learning is clustering an expression profiling microarray experiment into groups of genes with similar expression patterns.</li>

  <li>Other approaches to PR include <em>semi-supervised learning</em>, which uses pre-defined classes to find new similarity relationships and define new groups, and <em>reinforcement learning</em>, in which decisions are improved iteratively based on a feedback mechanism and specified reward criteria. In this educational article we focus on the application of supervised learning to automated analysis of microscopy image datasets.</li>
