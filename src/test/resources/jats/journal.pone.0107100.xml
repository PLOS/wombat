<abstract>
<p>Inferring new indication of approved drugs is critical not only for the elucidation of the interaction mechanisms between these drugs and their associated diseases, but also for the development of drug therapy for various human diseases. This paper proposes a network-based approach to reveal the association between 52 human diseases and potential therapeutic drugs based on multiple types of data. The advantage of the approach is that it can obtain the global relevance features for each drug-disease pair in the network by the learning local and global consistency method (LLGC). Cross-validation tests results demonstrate the proposed approach can achieve better performance comparing with previous methods. More importantly, it provides a promising strategy to maximize the value of therapeutic drugs and offer safe and effective treatments for different diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The traditional mode of drug development is a long and costly process. The investigation shows that it requires an investment of about $1 billion dollars and takes about 10∼15 years to take a compound from discovery to the approved medication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-DiMasi1">[1]</xref>. In fact, more than 90% of the drugs have been proved ineffective before being clinically tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Chong1">[2]</xref>. In order to improve the productivity of drug discovery, there is an urgent need for developing computational methods to address new treatment opportunities by utilizing the available information of known drugs. Undoubtedly, inferring novel indications of approved drugs is an effective way to achieve this important goal.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that genome-wide transcriptional expression data is useful to interpret biological influence of drugs or disease states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Schena1">[3]</xref>, there has been a trend for drug-disease study based solely on the analysis of gene expression data over the past years. The popular methods including Gene Enrichment Analysis method (GSEA) and the Connectivity Map (cMap) have proved effective in discovering new therapeutic drugs for some diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Shigemizu1">[4]</xref>. Both of the methods are based on the hypothesis that if two diseases share similar therapies, then the drug used for this disease may also be therapeutic for other diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Chiang1">[5]</xref>. For instance, GSEA can be used to determine whether a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Subramanian1">[6]</xref>. cMap is often used to seek the functional associations between drug response profiles and diseases through the transitory feature of common gene-expression changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Lamb1">[7]</xref>. However, the methods are greatly affected by the quality of gene expression data due to the profiles generated under different conditions. Therefore, it is incapability to capture drug-disease associations that are not manifested on the gene expression level.</p>
<p>Recently, some researchers attempted to incorporate the biological and chemical knowledge to construct effective feature vectors of drug-disease pairs with different learning methods. For instance, Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Li1">[8]</xref> proposed a literature mining method to build disease-specific drug protein cMaps via protein interaction networks. Gottlieb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Gottlieb1">[9]</xref> attempted to predict new drug indications by different feature information including gene expression profile, chemical structure, side effects and chemical protein interactome. Nevertheless, few researches have attempted to maximize the information flow in the disease network for uncovering new drug-disease pairs. Further, the similarity measure methods they used were limited and did not adjust the algorithm according to the specific situations of the samples.</p>
<p>Here, we propose a method by learning with local and global consistency (LLGC) to predict new drug-disease associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Zhou1">[10]</xref>. For each drug-disease pair in a network, we obtain the feature vectors of 609 known drug-disease associations based on different types of data. Compared with the PREDICT method, our method can obtain a higher specificity and sensitivity. Further, we expect the top-scored drug-disease pairs highly enriched in literature can be used for further clinical trial.</p>

<title>Data sets</title>
<p>In this work, we first collect 42 kinds of drugs associated with breast cancer from KEGG database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Kanehisa1">[11]</xref>. Then we obtain other 51 kinds of diseases with which the 42 drugs are associated. These 52 diseases totally have 609 known associations with 203 FDA approved drugs. Since each selected disease has at least one public associated drug with breast cancer, drugs treating one or several of these 51 diseases may also has some effect on treating breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Lamb1">[7]</xref>. Finally, we got 609 drug-disease pairs and 668 drug-target interaction pairs (192 targets corresponding to these 203 drugs) in the disease network.</p>

<title>Overview of the method</title>
<p>According to the LLGC method, we first constructed the disease-drug networks based on multiple types of feature information. Then, the feature vectors for all of the possible drug-disease pairs were obtained based on LLGC methods. Finally, new possible drug-disease associations can be predicted based on the analysis of network topology. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows an illustration of the above procedure.</p>

<title>Similarity measures</title>
<p>In the paper, four similarity measures were used to obtain results that are more reasonable.</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p><bold>Chemical structure similarity.</bold> SIMCOMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Hattori1">[12]</xref> is an online tool provided by the KEGG LIGAND database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/ligand" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/ligand</ext-link>), which offers a global similarity score by the ratio between the size of common sub-structures and the size of the union structures of two compounds. The similarity between two compounds c and c′ is usually computed as follows:</p>
</list-item></list>
<p><disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>SIMCOMP can only calculate the compounds whose similar scores are greater than a certain threshold. Therefore, we used the SIMCOMP2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/tools/simcomp2/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/tools/simcomp2/</ext-link>) to obtain the chemical structure similarity between any two compounds in order to construct a similarity matrix denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of drugs).</p>

<p>2. <bold>Phenotypic similarity.</bold> We used the phenotypic similarity constructed by van Driel et al. (2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-vanDriel1">[13]</xref>. The phenotypic similarity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was constructed by identifying the similarity between MeSH terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Lipscomb1">[14]</xref> appearing in the medical description of diseases from OMIM database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Hamosh1">[15]</xref> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of diseases).</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>3. <bold>Network topology information.</bold> In our study, we constructed an adjacency matrix to represent all of the known drug-disease associations. The underlying assumption here is that if two drugs (diseases) share more diseases (drugs), they are more similar. If a drug associates with a disease, the corresponding element was set a value 1. Otherwise, it was set a value 0. We defined two sharing degree similarity matrixes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on Xia et al.

Meanwhile, Floyd algorithm was used to seek the shortest paths between any two nodes in the graph M4 (has been described in Network topology features). For the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> drug, we obtain a vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> constituted of the lengths between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> drug and all of the diseases. Then we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the vectors of any two drugs to construct a similarity matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which reflects the topology similarities of drugs. Similarly, we construct a similarity matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to reflect the topology similarities of diseases.</p>

<p>Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of correlation between two variables <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, which is described as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e019"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e019" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Obviously, the absolute value of it is bigger, the degree of correlation between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> is higher. For two drugs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the shortest path similarity of them is computed as follows:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e022"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e022" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Based on the method of Perlman et al. (2011) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Perlman1">[17]</xref>, we combine two similarities including the sharing degree similarity and the shortest path similarity to a single topology similarity by computing their weighted geometric mean. In this way, we obtain the topology similarity matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

Similarly, the disease similarity matrix can be obtained by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the weight of biology similarity evaluation in the integrated similarity measure.</p>

<title>Construction of graph relevance vectors</title>
<p>The relevance between a drug D and a disease node in the disease network depends on whether the drug has an association with the disease. If the drug has an association with the disease, the relevance score is 1, otherwise the relevance score is 0. We can get the relevance score between disease S and a drug node in the disease network. The calculation process of the relevance score between a drug D (or a disease S) with a node in the disease network is introduced as follows:</p>

<p>We used the relevance score between drug D and other drug node to describe the drug similarity.

<p>Entropy is a measure of the uniformity of the energy distribution. Higher entropy means the message contain more information and vice versa. The calculation process of network structure entropy is described as follows:</p>
<p>For the undirected graph G that has m nodes, <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> is the degree of node <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>, then the importance of <italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic> is <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e040"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula></p>

<p>In order to eliminate the effect of the number of nodes on the entropy, we attempt to normalize the network structure entropy.

<p>As we can see from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0107100-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, the variation coefficient of degree<italic>ξ</italic>in these networks are high, indicating that the networks are all considerable heterogeneous (meaning that only a few nodes in the network have a large number of connections, most of the nodes only have a few connections).

<title>(4) Analysis of network reliability</title>
<p>In the paper, we analyze the effect of nodes removal on network reliability by randomly removing and determinately removing according to two methods. (a) Randomly removing a certain proportion nodes, removal ratio rises from 0% to 10%. (b) Orderly removing a certain proportion nodes of high degree, removal ratio rises from 0% to 10%.</p>
<p>The effect of these two operations on network connectivity efficiency and standard network structure entropy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>. For the random removal, we repeated this operation for 20 times and used their average values in order to avoid the deviation.</p>

<p>It is clear that the random removal of nodes has hardly affected the connectivity efficiency and standard network structure entropy of the networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Similarly, the sequential removal has little effect on the network connectivity efficiency, although the standard network structure entropy decreases slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). In summary, the influence caused by randomly removing and orderly removing on the disease network is very slight, which indicates that the disease network is of great shock resistance and reliability.</p>

<title>Learning with local and global consistency</title>
<p>The basic idea of LLGC method is to achieve a global stability result through the iteratively outward conductance of local known labels. In the study, all of the drug-disease pairs were first divided into two categories including the pairs with associations and the pairs without associations. Then, we construct a weighted undirected graph using the characteristic values of all the training data based on the manifold and clustering assumption. Nodes in the graph represented all the training examples, and a radial basis function was used to define the weights of edges in the graph.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the effect of the local label diffusion and emphasize the sparse zone of Euclidean distances, we improved the Gauss kernel function:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e045"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e045" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(15)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the variable parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the feature vector of a drug-disease pair.</p>
<p>We calculate the regularization matrix S of the weight matrix W in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e049"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e049" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>We make an iterative calculation through the iteration formula:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e050"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e050" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(17)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where Y is a drug-disease association matrix, the element in the <italic>i<sub>th</sub></italic> row and <italic>j<sub>th</sub></italic> column of Y represents whether the <italic>i<sub>th</sub></italic> disease and the <italic>j<sub>th</sub></italic> drug is a known drug-disease pair.</p>
<p>This iteration formula adheres to the concept of topological manifold, topologically mapping the neighborhood of points to the high dimensional space. Thus, the diffusion extent of the label of a point in the high dimensional space can be measured by the weights of edges passing through the point in the graph.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Algorithm analysis</title>
<p>According to the iteration formula, we discovery that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has a limit <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> only when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since S is a regularization matrix, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is inevitable, which means <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is existent. We can ignore the constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the calculation process, so we use <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to replace of the iteration formula in order to ensure that there is only truncation error. The energy function of LLGC learning method is described as:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e058"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e058" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(18)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>First, we can get the same iteration limit by calculating the derivative of the energy function.</p>
<p>Then, we set the initial labels of drug-disease pairs:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e059"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e059" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(19)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where F is a n×2 matrix.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyze the results and label the unknown drug-disease pairs:<disp-formula id="pone.0107100.e060"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0107100.e060" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(20)</label></disp-formula></p>

In order to compare the performance of our method with it, we executed 10-fold cross-validation procedures for 10 times: the dataset of drug-target pairs was divided into 10 subsets, each subset was then taken in turn as a test set and the remaining 9 folds were performed as training set. In each cross-validation, the 548 drug-disease associations are used for training classifier while the remaining 994 unknown drug-disease pairs and 61 drug-disease associations are designated as the testing dataset. The performances of the two methods are evaluated with two quality measures called AUC (Area under the ROC curve) and AUPR (Area under the precision-recall curve). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g008">Fi<bold>gure 8</bold></xref> shows the ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves of different methods. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the proposed method obtain the best results with the AUC score of 97.2% and AUPR score of 79.1%, which is increased by 4% on the AUC scores, and 11% on the AUPR scores comparing with PREDICT method.</p>

<title>Predicted drug-disease associations in the networks</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. It is estimated that more than 1.6 million new cases of breast cancer occurred among women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0107100-Siegel1">[22]</xref>. We focus on the drug-disease network for this important disease in the study. The topological graph of the predicted drug-disease network for breast cancer is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g009">Figure 9</xref>. We highlighted the predicted drug-disease associations with thick lines. It is shown that breast cancer may have associations with <italic>CISPLATIN</italic>, <italic>IFOSFAMIDE</italic>, <italic>CARBOPLATIN</italic>, <italic>Nedaplatin</italic> and <italic>Bleomycin hydrochloride</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g009"><bold>Figure 9</bold></xref>). Moreover, Doxorubicin and Ovarian cancer, PACLITAXEL and Cervical cancer should be associated drug-disease pairs.</p>

<p>As shown in the left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107100-g010">Figure 10</xref>, the drugs like <italic>ETOPOSIDE, Aclacinon, IRINOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE and EPIRUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE</italic> have many common targets. So we inferred these drugs may have similar pharmacological functions, thus can be used to treat the same diseases. On the other hand, these drugs have indeed associations with some common diseases in the disease network of breast cancer. Therefore, it is reasonable to encourage further investigation and consider progression to clinical trials for this important disease.</p>
