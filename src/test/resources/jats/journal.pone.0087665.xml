<abstract>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNAs that play pivotal roles in human cancer development and progression, such as tumor metastasis. Here, we identified the miRNAs that regulate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell migration by a high-throughput screening method using the classical wound-healing assay with time-lapse video microscopy and validation with a transwell migration assay. Eleven miRNAs (miR-134, -146b-3p, -188-3p, -525-3p, -661, -767-5p, -891a, -891b, -1244, -1247 and miR-1471) were found to promote or inhibit HCC cell migration. Further investigation revealed that miR-134 suppressed the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) was a direct and functional target gene of miR-134. Moreover, miR-134 inhibited the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the activation of RhoA downstream of the ITGB1 pathway, thereby decreasing stress fiber formation and cell adhesion in HCC cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that miR-134 is a novel metastasis suppressor in HCC and could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy in men, the seventh most common malignancy in women, and the third leading cause of cancer deaths, affecting over 500,000 people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-ElSerag1">[1]</xref>. HCC usually develops as a consequence of underlying liver disease and is most often associated with cirrhosis. Additionally, metastasis or recurrence commonly causes mortality in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Aravalli1">[2]</xref>. Metastasis is a complex and multistep biological process that includes local invasion, intravasation, survival in the circulation, extravasation, arrest at a distant organ site, micrometastasis formation and metastatic colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Valastyan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Steeg1">[4]</xref>. Each step requires the coordinated spatial and temporal expression of genes and proteins. Many molecules contribute to this process, and some of these molecules are involved in the mechanical aspects, whereas others modulate regulatory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Valastyan1">[3]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism of metastasis has not been comprehensively elucidated.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNAs that post- transcriptionally regulate the expression of target genes, usually by binding to the 3â²-UTR of the respective mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Ebert1">[5]</xref>. They are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Pauli1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Garofalo1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Li1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Huang1">[9]</xref>. Many previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in cell migration and the metastasis of several tumor types, such as breast cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Baranwal1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Le1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Huang2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Ding1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Ying1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Yao1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Tian1">[16]</xref>. However, the function and mechanisms of miRNA-mediated regulation of HCC metastasis are largely unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we performed a large-scale screening to identify the miRNAs involved in HCC cell migration by classical wound-healing assays with time-lapse video microscopy. After independent validation with transwell migration assays, we found that 11 miRNAs regulated the migration of HCC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. MicroRNA-134, the candidate tumor metastasis suppressor, is often downregulated in HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Li2">[17]</xref> and significantly inhibited invasion and metastasis by targeting the ITGB1 pathway in HCC.</p>

<title>Large-scale screening for miRNAs that regulate cancer cell migration</title>
<p>To screen for the miRNAs regulating cell motility, we utilized time-lapse video microscopy in the wound-healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Representative videos of the wound region and cell morphology are shown in the Supplementary Videos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s006">Video S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s007">Video S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s008">Video S3</xref>). Cells transfected with miR-891a migrated more quickly into the wound region than the negative control cells. In total, 646 miRNAs (miRBase 15.0, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s001">Table S1</xref>) were investigated. The primary screening indicated that 48 miRNAs regulated cell migration with an index value under â50% or over 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s004">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<p>To eliminate the impact of cell multiplication, we repeated the wound-healing assay with the selected 48 miRNAs in the presence of the proliferation inhibitor 2â², 3â²- dideoxythymidine (DDT); the movement induced by transfection with 22 miRNAs in the presence of DDT was similar to that in the primary screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s004">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm this result, we performed transwell migration assays in SK-HEP-1 cells transfected with the 22 miRNAs for 48 hours.

<title>miR-134 inhibits HCC cell invasion and metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To determine whether the enhanced expression of miR-134 inhibits HCC cell invasion and metastasis, we first measured the expression of miR-134 in various HCC cell lines and constructed three miR-134-overexpressing stable cell lines by lentiviral transduction (Figure S1A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s005">File S1</xref>).

In contrast, the suppression of endogenous miR-134 by its specific inhibitor enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities in Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To further explore the role of miR-134 in tumor invasion and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, MHCC-LM3 cells, which possess a relatively strong <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic capacity, were orthotopically transplanted into the livers of nude mice.

<title>miR-134 impacts ITGB1 expression by directly binding to its 3â²-UTR</title>
<p>Generally, miRNAs exert their function by binding to the 3â²-UTR of their target genes, blocking subsequent protein expression. Integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) and cadherin 9 (CDH9) were predicted to be the target genes of miR-134 by combining three target-predicting algorithms (PicTar, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pictar.org" xlink:type="simple">www.pictar.org</ext-link>, TargetScan, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org" xlink:type="simple">www.targetscan.org</ext-link> and miRanda, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org" xlink:type="simple">www.microrna.org</ext-link>). In addition, we performed an RNA microarray assay in SK-HEP-1 cells, and the results showed that the ITGB1 mRNA expression level decreased by 66% in miR-134 overexpressing cells compared with control cells (the expression ratio was 0.341524), whereas CDH9 mRNA expression levels remained relatively stable. These results indicate that ITGB1 is a putative target gene of miR-134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, analysis of the 3â²-UTR sequence of ITGB1 using TargetScan revealed two possible binding sites of miR-134, both of which are highly conserved in humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To further determine the direct binding of miR-134 to the 3â²-UTR, the fragments of the ITPG1 3â²-UTR (either wild-type or mutant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) were constructed and inserted downstream of the stop codon of Renilla luciferase in the psiCHECK2 vector. MiR-134 was cotransfected with different 3â²-UTR constructs into SK-HEP-1 cells. Compared to the control, the relative luciferase activity of wild-type 3â²-UTR of ITGB1 was sharply decreased by miR-134, whereas the relative luciferase activity of the 3â²-UTR construct containing two mutant binding sites was not altered. In addition, our results indicate that the two binding sites act synergically in miR-134 regulation because single mutation of these two binding sites only partially restored the luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar results were observed when different 3â²-UTRs constructed with psiCHECK2 were transfected into Huh-7 cells with the miR-134 mimic (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s005">File S1</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-134 remarkably decreased the endogenous mRNA and protein levels of ITGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3E, 3F</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of miR-134 increased the expression of ITGB1 in Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Collectively, these data provide further evidence that ITGB1 is a direct target of miR-134.</p>

<title>Restoration of ITGB1 abrogates miR-134-repressed HCC cell migration and invasion</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that the mRNA level of ITGB1 was upregulated in HCC samples compared to the adjacent normal liver tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Liu1">[20]</xref>. To explore whether ITGB1 contributes to the suppressive effect of miR-134, the complete ORF of ITGB1 without its 3â²-UTR, which resulted in the constitutive expression of ITGB1 resistant to miR-134 inhibition, was introduced into SK-HEP-1 and Huh-7 cells via lentiviral transduction. Remarkably, overexpression of ITGB1 strongly increased SK-HEP-1 and Huh-7 cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). We further observed that ectopic ITGB1-ORF without 3â²UTR in miR-134-transduced SK-HEP-1 and Hun-7 cells abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-134 on HCC migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>).

<title>Overexpression of miR-134 represses HCC cell stress fiber formation and cell adhesion</title>
<p>To further study the role of miR-134 in cell motility, we examined the status of stress fiber formation and polymerized actin in SK-HEP-1 and Huh-7 cells with miR-134 overexpression. Using phalloidin staining, we found that the maturation of stress fibers was suppressed in cells transfected with the miR-134 mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087665-g005">Figure 5A and 5C</xref>). However, miR-134 did not affect the consistency of vimentin or tubulin, which implies that miR-134 does not interfere the formation of intermediate filaments (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087665.s005">File S1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that time-lapse imaging of living cells is versatile for investigating cell mobility. This technique allowed us to investigate many phenotypes and morphologies associated with cell movement and mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Simpson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Fotos1">[23]</xref>. In this study, we used time-lapse video microscopy to observe cell movement in the scratch-wound assay, validated the results using the transwell migration assay, and identified the migration-suppressing miRNA (miR-134) and migration-facilitating miRNAs (miR-1247, miR-1244, miR-146b-3p, miR-1471, miR-188-3p, miR-661, miR-891a, miR-891b and miR-767-5P) in SK-HEP-1 cells.</p>
<p>miR-134 is located on chromosome 14q32.31, which is frequently lost in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Haller1">[24]</xref>, and its expression is often decreased in GIST, osteosarcoma, glioma and HCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Li2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Haller1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Sarver1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Lages1">[26]</xref>. Boominathan reported that TA-p73 may regulate the post-transcriptional processing of miR-134 by increasing Ago1/2 activity, thereby repressing cancer stem cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Boominathan1">[27]</xref>. However, the regulation of miR-134 expression in HCC remains to be elucidated. Moreover, low expression of miR-134 is significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival or tumor progression in GIST. Additionally, miR-134 inhibits cell migration and EMT in A549 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Zhang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Li3">[29]</xref>. Our previous work also demonstrated that miR-134 is often downregulated in HCC tissues, and its expression level is reversely correlated with HCC lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion. We also verified that ectopic expression of miR-134 suppresses HCC cell invasion and metastasis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The present work shows that miR-134 participates in the integrin-signaling pathway by directly regulating ITGB1 expression. ITGB1, which is a subunit of a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors, can combine with different integrin Î± subunits to form heterodimers and bind a large number of extracellular ligands. For example, Î±1Î²1, Î±2Î²1, Î±10Î²1 and Î±11Î²1 are collagen-binding integrins; Î±3Î²1, Î±6Î²1 and Î±7Î²1 bind to laminin and Î±4Î²1, Î±5Î²1, Î±8Î²1 and Î±vÎ²1 bind to fibronectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Brakebusch1">[30]</xref>. In many cancer types, integrin beta 1 promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival and regulates cell focal adhesion and tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-FeldingHabermann1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Caccavari1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Allen1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Grzesiak1">[34]</xref>. Masumoto reported that a monoclonal antibody against ITGB1 blocked HCC cell invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Masumoto1">[35]</xref>, and Mizuno found that overexpression of Î±3Î²1 integrins enhanced HepG2 cell migration and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Mizuno1">[36]</xref>, while inhibition of Î±3Î²1 integrins suppressed SMMC-7721 cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Fu1">[37]</xref>. Our study showed that ITGB1 promotes HCC cell migration and invasion and rescues miR-134-induced repression of cell migration and invasion. In addition, ITGB1 mRNA was upregulated in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal liver tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Liu1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>When extracellular ligands bind to integrins, their cytoplasmic domains connect to intracellular signaling molecules to activate an immediate signal transduction pathway or crosstalk with growth factor receptors. Then, FAK, the key molecule of the integrin-signaling pathway, is recruited to the integrin C-terminal domain and autophosphorylated at tyrosine397, thereby creating a binding site for the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain of Src. The active FAK-Src complex then promotes the activation of the small Rho family members, Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Huveneers1">[21]</xref>. RhoA is a crucial molecule in cell cytoskeleton remodeling and actin reorganization because it activates myosin II through Rho-kinase (ROCK) and contributes to actin polymerization in the formation of stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Rottner1">[38]</xref>. In addition to the inhibitory effect of miR-134 on ITGB1 expression, our data demonstrated that miR-134 affects FAK phosphorylation and RhoA activation in HCC cells. GTP-Rho is decreased and the formation of stress fibers is inhibited by overexpression of miR-134. Overexpression of ITGB1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-134 by increasing of GTP-Rho. When we knockdown RhoA, GTP-Rho decreases and the formation of stress fibers is suppressed.</p>
<p>Cell migration is frequently composed of the cycles consisting of protrusion at the front, the formation and stabilization of adhesions at the front and then the retraction and destabilization of adhesions at the rear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Rottner1">[38]</xref>. Protrusion may be mediated by a variety of distinct structures, including lamellipodia, filopodia and stress fibers. Rac1 stimulates lamellipodium formation, Cdc42 induces filopodium formation and RhoA induces the formation of stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0087665-Kaibuchi1">[39]</xref>. As miR-134 could reduce ITGB1 expression and the consequent FAK phosphorylation and RhoA activation, it is not surprising to find that miR-134 inhibits cell adhesion and migration in HCC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified potential tumor metastasis-regulating miRNAs through a cell migration assay. Our results show that miR-134 significantly inhibits HCC cell invasion and metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and further highlights the critical role of ITGB1 and its downstream pathway in miR-134-mediated inhibition of metastasis in HCC. This work suggests that miR-134 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.</p>
