sections:
# A list of supported sections.
# (Only one is present here, which is used as an example case to document everything.)
# Subthemes may override "sections" with a variable-length list.
# If this element is overridden, note that the entire "sections" list is overridden;
# it is not possible to override individual fields of a section and inherit the rest.
# The order is significant; it defines the order of the "supportedSections" model field,
# which can build a section menu.

  - name: "recent"
    # The section identifier.
    # Must be one of the valid values defined by org.ambraproject.wombat.controller.HomeController.SectionType.

    resultCount: 7
    # The number of articles to load into the model when this section is displayed.

    since: null
    # If null, use the default query behavior for this section. Must be null on all sections other than "recent".
    #
    # If a non-null number on "recent", query the service API for articles published that number of days ago. Enables
    # the "shuffle" and "articleTypes" special parameters.

    shuffle: false
    # Ignored unless "name" is "recent" and "since" is non-null.
    #
    # If true, when the number of articles returned for the "since" threshold is greater than resultCount, select a
    # random subset (of size equal to resultCount) and display them in a random order. Else, show them in chronological
    # order, regardless of how old they are.

    articleTypes: null
    # Ignored unless "name" is "recent" and "since" is non-null.
    #
    # Filter articles by these types. If enough have been published after the "since" threshold, sort them by type in
    # this order.

    cacheTtl: null
    # Ignored unless "name" is "recent" and "since" is non-null.
    #
    # Cache recent articles for this many seconds. If "shuffle" is true, articles are still shuffled every time the
    # home page is loaded, but the set from which articles are randomly picked is cached.

defaultSelection: "recent"
# The value must be either null or equal to the "name" value of one of the entries under "section".
# If null, the homepage takes no selection, and loads articles for every supported section into the model.
# If non-null, then the homepage has one selected section, and this is the default is none is queried for.
# This affects what is loaded into the model.

showsIssue: false
# If true, populate the model with metadata for the site's journal's current issue.

cacheTtl: null
# If this is non-null and the homepage uses any FetchHtmlDirectives, cache the written HTML for this many seconds.
# Has no effect if the homepage does not use a FetchHtmlDirective.
