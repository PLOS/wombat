<abstract>
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is mainly caused by mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) gene. Currently, the methods of whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing for screening mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia are not applicable in China due to high cost. We performed targeted exome sequencing of 167 genes implicated in the homozygous phenotype of a proband pedigree to identify candidate mutations, validated them in the family of the proband, studied the functions of the mutant protein, and followed up serum lipid levels after treatment. We discovered that exon 9 c.1268 T&gt;C and exon 8 c.1129 T&gt;G compound heterozygous mutations in the <italic>LDLR</italic> gene in the proband derived from the mother and father, respectively, in which the mutation of c.1129 T&gt;G has not been reported previously. The mutant LDL-R protein had 57% and 52% binding and internalization functions, respectively, compared with that of the wild type. After 6 months of therapy, the LDL-C level of the proband decreased by more than 50% and the LDL-C of the other family members with heterozygous mutation also reduced to normal. Targeted exome sequencing is an effective method for screening mutation genes in familial hypercholesterolemia. The exon 8 and 9 mutations of the <italic>LDLR</italic> gene were pedigree mutations. The functions of the mutant LDL-R protein were decreased significantly compared with that of the wild type. Simvastatin plus ezetimibe was proven safe and effective in this preschool-age child.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; MIM #143890) is a serious single-gene, dominant genetic disease. The main clinical manifestations are significantly elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The pathological basis of FH is LDL receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>; MIM #606945) gene mutations that cause cholesterol metabolism dysfunction. Clinically, FH is divided into homozygous and heterozygous phenotypes. The latter is relatively common and leads to premature coronary heart disease; it occurs in 1∶500 people in most countries. The former is rare, occurring in 1∶1,000,000 births; however, its symptoms are severe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Kim1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Kastelein1">[2]</xref>. However, as the most populous country in the world, China may bear a heavy burden of this genetic disorder. However, there is no applicable genetic screening method in clinical practice in China.</p>
<p>To date, 3 genes <italic>LDLR</italic>, apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) have been accepted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Chiou1">[3]</xref>. Reported mutations of FH widely spread over the coding regions of these causative genes. Genetic screening through traditional approaches, such as direct sequencing is therefore difficult. A high-throughput and cost-effective method to detect the genetic defects is needed. Whole exome sequencing has been proved to be a powerful tool to discover novel disease-related genes or genetic mutations in large genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Futema1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Motazacker1">[6]</xref>. With the progresses on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, it has been demonstrated to have higher efficiency but lower cost comparing with whole gene sequencing. However, the astronomical information amount, subsequent arduous data processing and large cost limit its widely application in practice in China. In this study, we utilized targeted exome sequencing (TES) to study genetic defects in one family, in order to establish a strategy feasible to genetic diagnosis of FH patients. We also studied the binding and internalization functions of the mutant protein and followed up the effect of lipid-lowering therapy in the pedigree.</p>

<title>Study Population and Data Collection</title>
<p>This study was part of a large study aimed at screening FH mutations using TES in the Han Chinese population. An FH family was recruited at Beijing Anzhen Hospital in February 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094697-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The proband (III-1) was a 5-year-old boy with distinct clinical features of skin xanthoma near the elbow, lap, and hips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094697-g002">Figure 2</xref>); his parents had no apparent clinical features but had high TC and LDL-C upon physical examination. Homozygous FH was diagnosed based on the following criteria: (1) plasma or serum LDL-C&gt;10 mmol/L; (2) presence of tendon and cutaneous xanthomas at an early age; (3) autosomal inheritance of hypercholesterolemia in relatives; (4) presence of primary hypercholesterolemia in the parents of the proband <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Bertolini1">[7]</xref>. Secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia were excluded. The clinical features of members in the FH family were investigated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094697-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

We washed the beads once with WB1 buffer at room temperature for 15 min and WB3 buffer thrice at 65°C for 15 min. Elution buffer was used to elute the bound DNA, which was amplified as follows: 98°C for 30 s; 98°C for 25 s, 65°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s (15 cycles); 72°C for 5 min. We purified the PCR product using SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) using the manufacturer's protocol.

<title>TES Identification of Candidate Mutations</title>
<p>We performed TES of 167 genes implicated in FH. The average sequencing depths on the targeted regions of samples that underwent TES was 640.32 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094697.s002">Table S2</xref>). The sample had 96.9% coverage of the targeted regions. Meanwhile, there was 92.3% and 89.3% coverage of targeted exons for 10 and 20 reads, respectively. Via SOAPsnp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Li2">[13]</xref>, an average 650 variants were identified in the sample. Among them were 386 non-synonymous variants, missense, nonsense, and splicing variants. This was narrowed down to 46 by excluding variants reported in HapMap 28 and the SNP release of the 1000 Genome Project with minor allele frequency&gt;0.05. For missense variants, computational prediction by PolyPhen, SIFT, PANTHER, PMUT and consistency of genetic transmission mode further narrowed the number of candidate mutations to &lt;8. For the 7 coding InDels initially identified in the sample using the Genome Analysis Toolkit program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-DePristo1">[15]</xref>, we identified 2 compound heterozygous variants(I402T and C356G) on LDLR gene that correlated with the disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094697-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Expanded Familial Validation and Sanger Sequencing Confirmation</title>
<p>We validated TES results from the proband to the entire family using Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing of the coding region confirmed that the I402T and C356G mutations were transmitted from the paternal grandmother (I-3) and the maternal grandfather (I-2), respectively. And, the heterozygous <italic>LDLR</italic> mutation I402T was carried by the father (II-2), uncle (II-3), and cousin (III-3), while the heterozygous <italic>LDLR</italic> mutation C356G was carried by the mother (II-1). But the sibling (III-2) carried no <italic>LDLR</italic> mutation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Estimated with the prevalence of heterozygous 1/500, there should be about 2.6 million potential FH patients in China, but the definitions of patients and potential patients are inconsistent. The first reason is that both doctors and patients have poor understanding of FH, and serum lipid levels are not examined during routine physical examination of children. On the other hand, only a few laboratories in China have the capability for detecting gene(s) mutations of FH. Therefore, a significant number of FH patients are not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Foreign research has shown that early diagnosis and intervention can delay the occurrence of complications of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in FH patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-EspinheiraMdo1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Elis1">[22]</xref>. Traditional screening for FH mutations is also infeasible because distribution of the mutation sites is scattered. Whole exome sequencing has been proved to be a powerful tool to discover novel disease-related genes or genetic mutations in large genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Futema1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Motazacker1">[6]</xref>, but clinical application in China is rarely accepted due to high cost. In the present study, we carried out TES for 167 genes implicated in FH and found that the average sequencing depth of the target genes was &gt;640, coverage of the target region was about 97%. The data from sequencing was about 650 Mb one sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094697.s002">Table S2</xref>), equal to about 10% of whole exome sequencing. Therefore, we have proved that deep exome sequencing of target 167 genes is a fast and efficient method to assist the diagnosis. The cost was saved at least 50% compared with whole exome sequencing, even less the amount of work saved. Notably, only a single sample from the proband was sufficient for identifying the causative mutation in the family; finalization could be enhanced using intra-familial mutation validation and co-segregation analysis. Therefore, there are 3 advantages of TES: 1) the genetic screening range can be reduced greatly; 2) data analysis can be performed with high efficiency; 3) it is much less expensive than whole exome sequencing.</p>
<p>The latest version of the LDL-R FH database of the University College London (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ldlr" xlink:type="simple">www.ucl.ac.uk/ldlr</ext-link>, accessed Jan 1, 2014) states that &gt;1125 <italic>LDLR</italic> gene variants worldwide, including different point mutations, small and large fragment deletions, insertions, rearrangements, and many new mutations, were recently discovered. The I402T mutation, transmitted from the paternal grandmother in the present study, has been reported in Switzerland, France, and Malaysia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Ekstrm1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Amsellem1">[25]</xref>, with binding and internalization functions of the mutant LDL-R protein decreasing to 59% and 54%, respectively, compared with the normal protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Chang1">[26]</xref>. The C356Y mutation (nucleotide change to c.1130G&gt;A) was first reported by Ekstrom in 1998 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Ekstrom1">[27]</xref>, but the C356G mutation (nucleotide change to c.1129T&gt;G) has not been reported previously. In this study, we concentrated on the effect of the novel C356G mutation on LDL-R function. Flow cytometry revealed that receptors with the C356G mutation had 57% binding activity compared with that of the wild-type receptor. The mutant receptor also displayed 52% internalization function compared to that of the wild-type. In the LDL-R protein, the C356G mutation is located in the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain B region, a disulfide- and cysteine-rich region. As this sequence is highly conserved, it may play an important functional role. It has been proven that the cysteine-to-glycine mutation has a marked effect on protein folding, impairing receptor function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Chang1">[26]</xref>. The epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain has been implicated in low-pH receptor recycling and lipoprotein release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Jeon1">[28]</xref>; therefore, mutations in this region will disrupt the natural primary function of the uptake of cholesterol-carrying particles into cells, thus lipids remain in the blood, resulting in hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p>The proband was diagnosed with compound heterozygous FH and was administrated with cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, simvastatin (dose titrated from 10 to 20 mg daily), accompany with diet therapy, though evidence of simvastatin use in child is limited. Four months later, the LDL-C decreased just by less than 50%, did not reach the target. We assumed that such a reduction amount may arise from either possible statin escape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Wu2">[29]</xref> or the sole blocking function of cholesterol synthesis but not cholesterol absorption. We combined simvastatin with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (10 mg daily); after 1 month, his LDL-C levels were reduced by 50% from baseline, consistent with the report by Catapano et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Catapano1">[30]</xref>. The therapy failed to lower LDL-C down to normal range. Nevertheless, the target (reduction ≥ 50%) recommended by the guideline was eventually met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-European1">[19]</xref>. During treatment, the skin xanthoma partly lightened and no subject developed the adverse reactions of liver function damage and creatine phosphokinase elevation; the growth in terms of height and weight of the children was unaffected as well. This lipid-lowering therapy not only is suitable for adult patients with hyperlipidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0094697-Ballantyne1">[31]</xref>, but also is safe for this preschool-age (&lt;6 years) compound heterozygous child.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of FH in China largely depends on clinical features, but patients with heterozygous mutations, such as the parents of the proband, often do not exhibit detectable clinical features. FH is detected in such patients only by measuring their cholesterol levels and by genetic diagnosis. In such patients, preventive treatment followed by early diagnosis is of great importance to avoid damage stemming from long-term elevation of cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>In summary, we successfully diagnosed FH genetically using next-generation sequencing methods and proved that it is a rapid, high-throughput, and efficient screening strategy. Briefly, TES of the 167 genes was sufficient and clinically useful for revealing genetic defects in patients with genetic dyslipidemia disease comprehensively.</p>
