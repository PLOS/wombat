      <abstract>
        <p>Many aspects of the immune system, including circulating cytokine levels as well as counts and function of various immune cell types, present circadian rhythms. Notably, the mortality rate of animals subjected to high doses of lipopolysaccharide is dependent on the time of treatment. In addition, the severity of symptoms of various inflammatory conditions follows a daily rhythmic pattern. The mechanisms behind the crosstalk between the circadian and immune systems remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that localized inflammation induced by turpentine oil (TURP) causes a time-dependent induction of interleukin (IL)-6 and has time-, gene- and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression. More precisely, TURP blunts the peak of <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the liver while in other tissues, the expression nadir is elevated. In contrast, <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> expression remains relatively unaffected by TURP treatment. Co-treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) did not alter the response of <italic>Per2</italic> to TURP treatment in liver, despite the reduced induction of fever and IL-6 serum levels. This indicates that the TURP-mediated changes of <italic>Per2</italic> in the liver might be due to factors other than systemic IL-6 and fever. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment had no effect on clock gene expression in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells. Altogether, we show that localized inflammation causes significant time-dependent changes in peripheral circadian clock gene expression, via a mechanism likely involving mediators independent from IL-6 and fever.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian clocks allow living organisms to adapt their internal biology to the 24 h day. Variations in environmental cues (or Zeitgebers) such as the light-dark cycle (LD), feeding times or socialization rhythms coordinate molecular circadian oscillations to daily cycles. Circadian clocks are endogenous to most cells in the body and their coordination is essential for internal homeostasis and health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Dibner1">[1]</xref>. The master pacemaker resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus and is necessary for the synchronisation of circadian oscillators located in other brain regions and most peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Dibner1">[1]</xref>. The central SCN clock elicits coordination of peripheral clocks through direct neuronal mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Buijs1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Vujovic1">[3]</xref> and humoral mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Balsalobre1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Pando1">[6]</xref>. The molecular clock is composed of clock genes including <italic>Clock, Bmal1, Cryptochromes (Cry)1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>, <italic>Periods (Per)1,</italic> and <italic>2</italic> and the orphan nuclear receptors <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> and <italic>Retinoid acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) α</italic>. These clock genes are involved in self-sustaining transcriptional feedback loops that occur with a period of approximately 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Duguay1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As is the case for various other regulatory systems, many aspects of the immune system show 24 h rhythms, including circulating cytokine levels and counts of various immune cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Haus1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Born1">[9]</xref>. In general, proinflammatory factors peak during the rest phase, which is the dark period in humans and the light period in nocturnal rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Lange1">[10]</xref>. Circadian rhythmicity of symptoms is common in inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Abad1">[11]</xref>. For example, patients suffering from sepsis have the highest susceptibility to mortality in the early morning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Hrushesky1">[12]</xref>, while patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma or ankylosing spondylitis experience their worse symptoms early in the morning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cutolo1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Smolensky1">[15]</xref>. In rodent models, treatment with the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the rest period (light phase) invokes a substantially higher mortality risk compared to animals treated in the active period (dark phase), paralleling peak cytokine induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Halberg1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Marpegan1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to this circadian control of inflammatory processes, inflammatory stimuli can impose changes in both central and peripheral circadian clocks. In humans, LPS administration suppresses clock gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Haimovich1">[18]</xref> Similarly, rodents treated with LPS show suppressed molecular rhythms in both central and peripheral clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Okada1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Yamamura1">[20]</xref> and a phase shift of behavioural circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Marpegan2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Different inflammatory mediators were proposed to influence central and peripheral clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cavadini1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Ohdo1">[24]</xref>, which could be responsible for the circadian disruptions following an endotoxin challenge. For instance, IL-6 was shown to stimulate <italic>Per1</italic> promoter activity in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Motzkus1">[25]</xref>, but nothing is known on its effect on clock genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) time-dependently suppresses the expression of many clock genes both in cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cavadini1">[22]</xref> and suppresses melatonin in the pineal gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-CarvalhoSousa1">[26]</xref>. Finally, interferon alpha (IFNα) suppresses <italic>Per1</italic> in mouse liver and adrenal glands, but only with treatment during the active phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Ohdo1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we address the effects of localized inflammation induced with turpentine oil (TURP) treatment on peripheral clock gene expression. An intramuscular TURP injection creates a sterile abscess and inflammation characterized by local synthesis of IL-1β and TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Luheshi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Zheng1">[28]</xref>. These cytokines do not enter circulation, but induce the synthesis of IL-6, which then induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 gene transcription and prostaglandin (PG)E<sub>2</sub> production in the brain thermoregulatory centres, leading to fever development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Zhang1">[29]</xref>. Compared to LPS, TURP presents clear advantages to decipher the mechanism behind the effects of inflammation on circadian clocks. First, TURP elicits a simpler cytokine response, with IL-6 being the only circulating proinflammatory cytokine. Second, the slower time-course of TURP (6 h–10 h to reach maximal IL-6 levels and fever) compared to LPS (2 h–4 h) allows correlations to be made between inflammatory mediators and changes in clock gene expression. Using this strategy, we show that TURP elicits time-, tissue- and gene-specific effects on peripheral clock gene expression. Further, we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying these effects both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that despite the correlative peak changes of IL-6 with <italic>Per</italic> gene expression in the liver and heart, IL-6 does not seem to act directly to mediate these effects.</p>

        <p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old, weighing 250–300 g at the time of experiment; Charles River, Saint Constant, QC, Canada) were used in the experiments. The animals were housed individually in a controlled environment with a regular 12 h:12 h LD cycle (∼200 lux in the light periods) in an ambient temperature of 21±2°C. Regular chow and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>

      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>Treatments</title>
        <p>In all experiments, animals were treated with either 0.1 mL of purified turpentine oil (TURP) (Riedel-deHaen, Sleeze, Germany) or 0.1 mL of sterile physiological saline by intramuscular (I.M.) injection into the right gastrocnemius muscle (hind-limb).</p>
        <p>In one experiment, animals were treated with human recombinant (hr) IL-1Ra (provided by Dr. Stephen Poole, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Hertfordshire, UK). Animals were treated intraperitoneally (I.P.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after TURP treatment. The hrIL-1Ra was dissolved in physiological saline to a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and control animals were treated similarly with an equal volume of physiological saline.</p>
        <p>The times of treatment and sacrifice varied depending on the experiment. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation, blood was collected by trunk bleed into sterile tubes and serum was isolated by immediate centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. Aliquots were made and samples frozen at −80°C until use. Livers, hearts, kidneys and spleens were collected upon sacrifice, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use.</p>
        <p>Analgesics were not used in our study, primarily because of the potential impact on some of our endpoint measures: Analgesics were shown to alter inflammatory responses and to affect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Lee1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Spinas1">[31]</xref>. Moreover, analgesic treatment has impacts on circadian rhythms and on clock gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Hood1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Vansteensel1">[33]</xref>. Additionally, the pain experienced by the rats upon injection of the dose of TURP used in our study (0.1 mL) is relatively minor, compared to the effects of the higher dose of 0.6 mL of TURP used in some of our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cooper1">[34]</xref>, and the animals did not exhibit any outward signs of distress nor any pain-induced vocalization.</p>

          <p>The rapid and transient increase in temperature observed in all experiments right after injection of TURP or saline is due to a stress response consequent to both handling and injection. Since this increase is seen in both the saline and TURP groups and is of lower magnitude than the TURP-induced fever, and given the long time course of cytokines and fever in the TURP model (6–10 h before reaching a peak response), this initial transient increase in temperature did not likely affect our observations and conclusions.</p>

IL-1Ra is a competitive antagonist of the IL-1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Luheshi2">[36]</xref> and consequently, it blocks IL-6 induction and fever in the TURP model by acting on IL-1 receptor at the site of localized inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Luheshi2">[36]</xref>. The co-injection of hrIL-1Ra and TURP was used to assess the contribution of IL-6 to clock gene expression changes. At ZT2, animals were treated with either saline or TURP (I.M.) and in each group, the animals were also injected several times with either saline or hrIL-1Ra (I.P.). Two times of sacrifice were investigated based on the times of greatest change in Experiments 1 and 2: ZT12 and ZT16 TOS (10 h and 14 h after treatment, respectively). Altogether there were 4 groups per time point of sacrifice: saline-saline, saline-hrIL-1Ra, TURP-saline, and TURP-hrIL-1Ra.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report that TURP-induced inflammation produces time-, gene-, and tissue-specific changes in clock gene expression in rat peripheral tissues. Interestingly, alterations in liver clock gene expression correlate with changes in IL-6 expression. However, by co-treatment with the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra, we show that systemic IL-6 does not seem to contribute to the suppression of <italic>Per2</italic> in the liver. Accordingly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture study also suggests that IL-6 does not act directly on liver cells to induce changes in clock gene expression.</p>
      <p>Studies show that fever parallels IL-6 induction in the TURP model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Luheshi1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Turnbull1">[50]</xref>. This is indeed what we have observed when TURP treatment was done in the morning (<italic>in vivo</italic> experiment 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, by comparing the outcome of treatment at different times of day (<italic>in vivo</italic> experiment 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we demonstrate that the serum concentration of IL-6 ten hours after TURP treatment is dependent on the time of injection. On the other hand, fever remains largely independent of TURP injection time (except the slight reduction upon sacrifice at ZT0). The magnitude of the systemic fever response was shown by others to be independent of the time of LPS treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Severinsen1">[51]</xref>, although the rise in temperature in the brain is dependent on this timing of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Mathias1">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A possible explanation for the time-dependent induction of IL-6 could lie in the balance of rhythmic humoral factors. One possibility is the balance of melatonin and glucocorticoids, rhythmic hormones that are immune-activating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-CarrilloVico1">[53]</xref> and immune-suppressing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Webster1">[54]</xref>, respectively, which might be differentially regulated by the treatment at different times of day. Melatonin was also shown to act on LPS-induced intracellular signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Tamura1">[55]</xref>. Another possibility for the time-dependency of IL-6 response to TURP is a circadian regulation of cytokine secretion by immune cells upon stimulation by a pro-inflammatory agent, as was shown for the LPS treatment of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Gibbs1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Narasimamurthy1">[58]</xref> and the activation of splenocytes through toll-like receptor 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Silver1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We observed large TURP-mediated changes in clock genes expression that were time-, tissue- and gene-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g004">4</xref>). <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> gene expression in the liver was downregulated at their normal peak (early dark phase) upon morning TURP treatment. In contrast, the effects on <italic>Per</italic> genes in other tissues were stronger when treatment occurred in the night, with an elevation of the expression nadir in the middle of the light phase. Effects on <italic>Rev-erbα</italic> mRNA levels were more subtle, but included a similar decrease of peak mRNA levels in the daytime after night-time treatment in the liver, kidney and spleen.</p>
      <p>LPS and TURP constitute different models of inflammation: LPS provokes a fast systemic inflammatory response while TURP induces a slower response to a localized inflammation. Despite these differences, clocks respond in a similar manner to both agents. Notably, <italic>Per1</italic>/<italic>Per2</italic> RNA levels at their peak expression in the early dark phase are blunted by LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Okada1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Yamamura1">[20]</xref> and by TURP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g004">4</xref>) in the liver. In addition, both LPS and TURP invoke tissue-specific effects on peripheral clock genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Yamamura1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g004">4</xref>). However, the limited number of circulating mediators in TURP-induced inflammation and its slower time-course make this model superior to tease apart the mechanisms accounting for the effects. In this respect, in the liver and to a certain extent in the heart, the maximal change in IL-6 corresponds with the reduced peak of <italic>Per</italic> gene expression. This suggests that IL-6 may contribute to the changes in clock gene expression induced by TURP treatment.</p>
      <p>To test the influence of proinflammatory factors on clock gene expression in the TURP model, animals were treated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra. IL-1Ra blocks the binding of IL-1β to its receptor, thus effectively eliminating the upregulation of systemic IL-6 as IL-1β is required for the upregulation of IL-6 in the TURP model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Zheng1">[28]</xref>. Using this model, there was an expected attenuation of liver <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the TURP-treated groups sacrificed both 10 and 14 h after treatment (ZT12 and ZT16 TOS); however unexpectedly, <italic>Per1</italic> was not downregulated at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Experiment 1 demonstrated that the downregulation of <italic>Per1</italic> is transient (compared to the sustained downregulation of <italic>Per2</italic>), thus it is possible that our sampling missed the expected suppression of <italic>Per1.</italic> Considering <italic>Per2</italic> however, we observed that hrIL-1Ra treatment did not rescue the TURP-induced suppression despite the strong attenuation of IL-6 at sacrifice. This suggested that systemic IL-6 elevation did not induce the changes in liver clock gene expression.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that TNFα, but not IL-6, suppresses clock gene expression in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cavadini1">[22]</xref>. In another study, IL-6 used at a higher concentration downregulated <italic>Per1</italic> promoter activity in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Motzkus1">[25]</xref>. We determined that systemic IL-6 does not affect <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the liver, but it remains possible that a tissue-specific regulation of IL-6 could contribute to clock gene regulation. In one study, it was found that <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA was upregulated in the muscle tissue where TURP was injected, but downregulated in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Sheikh1">[40]</xref>. Also, IL-6 in the interstitial fluid of adipose tissue is 100 times higher than in the serum and acts as a potent paracrine signaling agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Sopasakis1">[60]</xref>. Finally, it was shown that in response to LPS, IL-6 levels in spleen lymph were enriched compared to those in serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Semaeva1">[61]</xref>. These local IL-6-enriched microenvironments could uniquely influence clock gene expression in particular tissues.</p>
      <p>The action of IL-6 could also depend on the differential expression of its receptor. IL-6 can act via IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which dimerizes with gp130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Taga1">[62]</xref>, or by binding to the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), which then binds to gp130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Mitsuyama1">[63]</xref>. Both cases initiate the JAK-STAT pathway. While only hepatocytes and some immune cells contain IL-6R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Scheller1">[64]</xref>, gp130 is ubiquitously expressed and can thus bind sIL-6R in various tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Mitsuyama1">[63]</xref>. It is possible that any of these proteins (IL-6R, gp130 or sIL-6R) are expressed rhythmically, thereby gating the response to IL-6 to induce different magnitudes of response depending on the time of day. To test whether IL-6 can act directly on the clock in liver cells, we treated liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) with IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The absence of effect on clock genes in this assay suggests that IL-6 does not have a direct effect on clock gene expression in liver cells.</p>
      <p>Apart from IL-6, other humoral factors may impinge on the clock, as it has been shown that other cytokines can be upregulated in various tissues in the TURP model. Interferon(IFN)-γ and IFN-α treatment at ZT12 (but not ZT0) disturbs <italic>Per</italic> gene expression in both the liver and SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Ohdo1">[24]</xref>. TNFα was shown to suppress clock gene expression both in synchronized fibroblasts and in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Cavadini1">[22]</xref>. Another proinflammatory factor, PGE<sub>2</sub>, was shown to have clock gene-modulating effects, inducing transient <italic>Per1</italic> expression in cultured fibroblasts and time-dependent circadian phase shifts in peripheral clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Murphy1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Tsuchiya1">[66]</xref>. Finally, leptin is an energy-regulating hormone that can act as a proinflammatory cytokine during a febrile response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Luheshi3">[67]</xref> and rises in response to inflammatory signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Sarraf1">[68]</xref> including TURP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-AguilarValles1">[69]</xref>. Interestingly, leptin treatment can alter the phase of the clock both centrally and peripherally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Mendoza1">[70]</xref>, and mice lacking functional leptin (<italic>ob/ob</italic> mice) exhibit disrupted clock gene expression in both adipose tissue and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Ando1">[71]</xref>. Given that leptin serum levels vary over the day and are controlled by the SCN central clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Kalsbeek1">[72]</xref>, this hormone could possibly gate the response to inflammatory signals, thus imposing a time-dependent regulation on clock gene expression.</p>
      <p>In addition to humoral factors, neuronal connections and systemic cues such as body temperature or pain might mediate the effects of TURP on clock genes. To our knowledge, there are no reports of an effect of pain on clock genes. Moreover, the levels of pain in our TURP inflammation model is very low compared to established models of pain, which makes it an unlikely mediator for the strong effects we see in clock gene expression. Cycles of temperature changes are thought to participate in circadian gene expression in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Brown1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Saini1">[75]</xref>, with a mechanism that involves the heat-sensing transcription factor Heat Shock Factor 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Buhr1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Tamaru1">[76]</xref> and the cold-sensing factor Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Morf1">[77]</xref>. In fact, <italic>Per2</italic> itself has HSF1 binding sites in its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Tamaru1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Kornmann1">[78]</xref>. However, while fever induction is relatively independent of the time of injection, clock gene expression changes are injection time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g002">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g004">4</xref>). Furthermore, our data showed that <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA repression by TURP treatment was unchanged even when IL-1Ra co-treatment strongly reduced fever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g005">Figs 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059808-g006">6</xref>). Therefore, although we cannot exclude that the remaining fever following co-treatment with IL-1Ra might still be sufficient to affect clock genes, we believe that temperature is an unlikely mediator for the clock gene expression changes we have observed in the liver. Regarding a possible neuronal influence, sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways are likely to be involved in the entrainment of peripheral circadian clocks as there are many neuronal connections from the SCN to peripheral tissues including the liver, kidney, heart, muscle and spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Buijs1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Maier1">[79]</xref>. For example, <italic>Per1</italic> gene expression is quickly induced in the adrenal glands upon light stimulation, an induction that is lost in animals with adrenal denervation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Ishida1">[80]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It was found that the clocks in different tissues have different sensitivities to humoral cues and it is likely that balance of neuronal and humoral cues together coordinate tissue-specificity in peripheral clock entrainment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Vujovic1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Guo1">[5]</xref>. In particular, it was previously shown that the liver and kidney seem to be more sensitive to humoral cues, whereas the heart, spleen and muscle require other input – probably neuronal – to fully entrain their clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059808-Guo1">[5]</xref>. Such differences in the response of tissues to different types of cues might contribute to the tissue-specific response to TURP that we have observed.</p>
      <p>Here, we have found that TURP-mediated inflammation induces time-, tissue- and gene-specific effects in peripheral circadian clocks. This localized inflammation model will help to identify the mediators underlying the impact of inflammation on circadian rhythms. Characterizing the changes in peripheral clock gene expression upon inflammation is essential to decipher the mechanisms behind time-dependent susceptibilities to inflammatory responses.</p>
