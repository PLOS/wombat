<p>As a devastating holoparasitic weed, <italic>Orobanche aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon. (Egyptian broomrape) causes serious damage to agricultural production and threatens economic development, which has raised widespread concern. The present study was conducted to determine whether lilies have the potential to be used as ‘trap crops’ for controlling <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon. In the experiments, the ability of three popular lily cultivars (<italic>Lilium</italic> Oriental hybrids ‘Sorbonne’, <italic>Lilium</italic> LA (Longiflorum hybrids x Asiatic hybrids) hybrids ‘Ceb Dazzle’, and <italic>Lilium</italic> Longiflorum hybrids (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>formosanum</italic> x <italic>L</italic>. <italic>longiflorum</italic>) ‘<italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic>’) to induce <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon. seed germination was assessed. Parts of the three lily cultivars, including the rhizosphere soil and underground and above-ground organs, all induced “suicidal germination” of parasitic <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon. seed at four growth stages. Specifically, Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle behaved with similar allelopathy, and the bulb, scale leaf and aerial stem exhibited stronger allelopathic effects on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. germination compared to other organs. Aqueous L. <italic>formolongo</italic> leaf extracts may contain more stable, effective stimulants given that they induced the highest germination rate at 76.7% even though the extracts were serially diluted. We speculate that these organs may be advantageous in further isolating and purifying economical active substances that can be substitutes for GR24. These results indicate that lilies have the potential to be used as a trap crops or can be processed into green herbicide formulations that can be applied in agriculture production to rapidly deplete the seed bank of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon. parasitic weeds in soil.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. (broomrapes), a type of widely distributed holoparasitic weed found throughout the Mediterranean region, Western Asia and Eastern Europe, causes enormous economic loss by parasitizing primarily on Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Cruciferae Apiaceae and Gramineae plants for nutrients and water [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Of the diverse <italic>Orobanch</italic> spp. species, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Persoon., <italic>O</italic>. <italic>cernua</italic> Loefl., <italic>O</italic>. <italic>crenata</italic> Forsk., <italic>O</italic>. <italic>Cumana</italic> Wallr., <italic>O</italic>. <italic>minor</italic> Sm. and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>ramosa</italic> L. have a wide parasitizing spectrum and are capable of doing more harm than any of the other <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. species [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>A large reserve of <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. seeds exist in infected soils, and it is too labor intensive and ineffective to reduce the seed bank using mechanical, manual or pesticide application [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Controlling parasitic weeds with trap crops may be a biologically promising and practical method in farming. Trap crops are non-host species whose roots exude chemical stimulants required for parasite germination without haustoria formation [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To date, many efforts have been implemented to screen various trap crops for use against parasitic weeds. For example, wheat, maize, rice, cotton, soybean and rape have been identified as trap crops in controlling <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Researchers have isolated and identified the exudates produced and released by the roots of host and some non-hosts plants, such as tomato, sorghum, maize, pea and Arabidopsis. Secondary metabolites called strigolactones (SLs) have been confirmed as the major class of stimulants that induce parasitic <italic>Orobanche</italic> and <italic>Striga</italic> spp. seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, many studies have shown that field applications of SLs or synthetic SL analogue stimulants, such as GR24, GR3 and Nijmegen1, provide partial control of <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. due to instability of the compound, particularly under alkaline conditions [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. And now GR24 is usually used as a general standard in germination assays, which elicits &gt;60% germination at 100 nM. Therefore, it is necessary to select more potential trap crops and stable allelopathic substances from non-hosts of <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp., which contribute to the synthesis of more effective germination stimulants such as SLs. A good focus of allelopathy has been done on grain, vegetable crops and traditional medicinal herbs for <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp., while few studies have been conducted on the allelopathic effects of ornamental plants for <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to abundant bioactive constituents in bulbs, lilies are popular ornamental plants that are also used as medicinal herbs in China for treatment of various human and animal diseases [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Significant allelopathic effects caused by unknown secondary metabolites have been shown to be key factors that lead to continuous cropping obstacles in lilies [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether <italic>Orobanche</italic> spp. germination inducers are available in lilies. The objective of this study was to compare extracts from three popular lily cultivars at various growth stages on inducement of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. germination. This information can further expand applications in weed control based on ornamental and edible lily components.</p>

<title>Experiment Materials and Chemicals</title>
<p>Three popular lily cultivars, <italic>Lilium</italic> Oriental hybrids (some lily species were selected as parents in hybridized breeding) ‘Sorbonne’, <italic>Lilium</italic> LA (Longiflorum hybrids x Asiatic hybrids) hybrids ‘Ceb Dazzle’ and <italic>Lilium</italic> Longiflorum hybrids (<italic>L</italic>.<italic>formosanum</italic> x <italic>L</italic>.<italic>longiflorum</italic>) ‘<italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic>’, were purchased from Beijing Sheng sitong Ecological Technology co., LTD at Changping district of Beijing. Pot experiments were conducted at the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing, China in January 2014. Pots were placed in a greenhouse at an approximate temperature of 25°C with daily sunlight. Pots were watered as necessary and kept moist. Experimental soil was mixed using peat and sand at a ratio of 2:1 with a pH of 6.83. Two bulbs of each lily cultivar were planted in a plastic pot (15 cm high by 20 cm diameter) containing 1.5 kg of soil.</p>
<p><italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds collecting in 2010 from infested tomato (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>esculentum</italic> Mill) fields in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China and the synthetic strigolactone GR24 were supplied by Professor Yongqing Ma in 2013 (Institute of Soil and Water Conservation and Northwest Agriculture &amp; Forestry University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yangling, Shanxi, China). The seeds were stored by a sealed plastic tube and placed in a cool, dry and dark environment. The GR24 were stored in the refrigerator at -20°C.</p>
<p><italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds were surface-sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite (v/v) for 3 min and thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water. Approximately 30 air-dried <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds were sown on each glass fiber disk Glass (5 mm diameter) which was arranged evenly on the double moist filter paper placed in the 7 cm Petri dishes. Then 1 mL of the distilled water as ‘conditioning medium’ was added into Petri dishes, making the seeds to touch a wet surface without soaking. Finally, sealed Petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 25°C for conditioning period of 2 days and then used in germination bioassays [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Collection of Lily Rhizosphere Soils and Plant Samples</title>
<p>Rhizosphere soils and lily plant samples were collected at four developmental stages (sprouting, the terminal bud began to sprout and grow to about 10–15 cm; leaf expansion, the flower bud was forming and the stem grown to about 40–45 cm; flowering, most of flower buds was blooming; and increasing bulblet weight, about 3 weeks after all the flowers withered). At each samples-taking stage, three pots per cultivar were picked out as three individual repetitions, at the same time, both lily plants in each pot have been divided into six tested parts respectively and the same tested parts between them were mixed as one sample.</p>
<p>Specifically, the lily’s root plus adhering soil carefully picked out of the nonrhizosphere soil. The loosely held soil was gently shaken off the roots, which was referred to as rhizosphere soil [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. And the whole lily plant was divided into six tested parts, including the aerial stem, leaf and prop root belonging to above-ground organs and the bulb, scale leaf and roots as underground components. Each tested part rinsed thoroughly with water was shade-dried and then milled to pass through a 0.45 mm sieve. The final powder collected as tested part sample was stored at 0–5°C for further tests as described below, and when the power was extracted, each treatment was replicated three times.</p>

<title>Preparation of Aqueous and Methanol Extracts</title>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Aqueous Extracts</title>
<p>Rhizosphere soil sample collected from pot-cultivated lilies (5 g) plus 10 mL distilled water were ultrasonic treated for 30 min and then filtered. The filtered solutions are hereafter referred to as the undiluted rhizosphere soil extracts. Lily powder (0.1 g) sample made from above- and underground components was placed into a centrifuge tube (1.5 mL) and mixed with distilled water. The mixture was treated by ultrasound for 30 min and centrifuged at 6400 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant obtained was collected as undiluted plant sample extracts. These undiluted extracts were further diluted 10-, 100- and 1000-fold with distilled water. A total of 30 μL of each extract was added to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds on glass fiber disks in Petri dishes. Each treatment was replicated three times. Sealed Petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 25°C for 7 d, and the germination rate was examined with a microscope. Conditioned <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds treated with GR24 and distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Methanol Extracts</title>
<p>Four concentrations of methanol extracts were obtained in the same manner as the aqueous extracts. In addition, 30 μL of the methanol extracts were added to an empty glass fiber filter disk without seeds and allowed to evaporate for 30 min at room temperature. A second glass fiber disk with conditioned <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds was placed on top of the empty glass fiber disk. Autoclaved distilled water (30 μL) was added to the double glass fiber disks. Each treatment was replicated three times. Conditioned <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds treated with GR24 and methanol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Remaining test procedures were similar to those described above [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Data were processed using Excel 2007, SPSS17.0 and 3.1.2 R software. Duncan's multiple range test was used to separate the means. Treatment means were compared using least significant difference tests at a 5% level of probability.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Germination rates of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds increased up to 90% when treated with the positive control GR24, while germination did not occur in seeds treated with distilled water and methanol, indicating that the <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds were viable. In addition, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. showed no seed germination when treated with aqueous and methanol extracts of potting substrates without cultivating lily plant. It may also illustrates that allelochemicals secreted by lily root include obligate germination stimulants for <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. and also eliminate interference of soil condition.</p>

<title>Induction of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. Seed Germination at the Sprouting Stage</title>
<p>At the sprouting stage, all three of the lily cultivars had broken dormancy with a short terminal bud. At terminal bud height about 10–15 cm, the bulb, scale leaf and root belonging to underground organs were selected for testing. <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. showed no germinated at all when treated with undiluted aqueous and methanol extracts. With increased extract dilutions, germination rates generally increased at first and then declined (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The highest germination rates were induced by 10-fold or 100-fold dilution of aqueous and methanol extracts.

<title>Induction of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. Seed Germination at the Leaf Expansion Stage</title>
<p>At the leaf expansion stage, bulblets arose from the bulb base between two scales in which stored nutrients were being consumed.

<title>Rhizosphere Soil from Lily Cultivars Stimulates <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. Seed Germination</title>
<p>Rhizosphere soil extracts from three different lily cultivars induced parasitic <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seed germination at all four growth stages, showing the strongest allelopathic effects at the flowering stage (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This suggests that lily roots may continuously secrete allelopathic compounds into the soil over time.</p>
<p>Germination rates induced by lily rhizosphere soil extracts varied significantly depending on concentration (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Researchers have noted that most allelopathic substances stimulate seed germination at low concentrations and inhibit germination at high concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which is in agreement with the results of the present study. Specifically, undiluted rhizosphere soil aqueous and methanol extracts induced little or no germination of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers., while most inhibitory effects vanished and germination rates gradually increased when extracts were diluted to 1000-fold. This indicates that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seed germination could be stimulated within a considerable distance of lily roots. Future studies should investigate whether germination rates continue to increase under more dilute conditions.</p>
<p>Some researchers have reported that methanol extracts generally induce higher germination rates than aqueous extracts. One possible explanation was that extracts might contain unknown germination inhibitors that might not remain stable and could become volatile in the presence of methanol [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the results of the present study were not consistent with a previous study in which germination rates induced by aqueous lily rhizosphere soil extracts were higher or similar to methanol extracts (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). On the one hand, we speculated that aqueous lily rhizosphere soil extracts might contain more hydrophilic allelochemicals or fewer unknown inhibitors, suggesting that stimulant allelopathic effects from lily rhizosphere soil on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seeds would be stronger under leaching conditions [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. One the other hand, some researchers found that environmental conditions affected production and/or exudation of SLs known as the major germination stimulants of <italic>Striga</italic> and <italic>Orobanche</italic>. For example, it have already been proved that SLs exudation is promoted in response to soil nutrient deficiency and the stability of SLs rapidly would decrease at alkaline condition [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, taking these factors into consideration, we also speculated that slightly acid soil condition of lily might protect these compounds from disruption and decomposition.</p>
<p>In addition, the strongest stimulating allelopathic effects of rhizosphere soil extracts from Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle were exhibited at the flowering stage, while the effects were shown at the leaf expansion stage for <italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Similarly, the study of the root exudates of tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> Mill.) genotypes effect on seed germination of <italic>Orobanche</italic> has revealed that significant variations of germination-stimulating capacities in relation to plant age, probably because of different production of stimulant [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It also have been confirmed that root exudates of peanut (<italic>Arachis hypogaea L</italic>.) exhibit qualitative and quantitative changes in their composition with the increasing age of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, it could be that type and concentration of allelopathic substances might vary at the various growth stage of lily, which caused that allelopathy varies based on lily growth and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic> has different allelopathic effects compared to the other two cultivars. Overall, these results suggest that lily cultivars have the potential to be used as trap crops to reduce <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seed banks.</p>

<title>Allelopathic Effects on <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. Seed Germination may Vary among Lily Cultivars or Organs</title>
<p>It has been reported that one single plant species can produce several different types and quantities of strigolactones, and within the same species, different varieties may also produce different combinations of strigolactones [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This conclusion is similar to findings in grain crop and vegetable crop studies, such as soybean, wheat, cotton and hybrid, in which allelopathy can vary dramatically among cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Comparing allelopathy among above- and underground organs from three different lily cultivars, it was determined that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic> was significantly different in the ability to stimulate <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seed germination with respect to the Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle cultivars, which had similar allelopathic effects.</p>
<p>For Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle, bulb and scale leaf from the underground organs exhibited the strongest stimulant allelopathy, and above-ground organs from both cultivars generally had weaker stimulant allelopathy at the same growth stage. Regardless of growth stage, aqueous and methanol leaf extracts had the lowest capacity to induce <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. seed germination (Figs <xref rid="pone.0142811.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142811.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). However, these results were not consistent with recent studies in which allelopathic substances produced by cotton and potato root were transported upwards and retained in above-ground parts, resulting in a positive relationship between root and stem or leaf [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Instead, our results showed that a transition between organ types occurred at a specific turning point (i.e., leaf expansion stage), with the strongest stimulant allelopathy from the bulb to scale leaf in underground organs during lily growth (<xref rid="pone.0142811.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Actually, recent experiments have demonstrated that the function of SLs or their metabolites in the rhizosphere were synthesized in both roots and stem and transported upward in xylem for control of shoot branching. This means that SLs may have the certain mode of action and exist in some parts of plant [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Based on these facts, we presume that sophisticated components of the bulbous lily plant are likely the main causes of a distinct allelochemical transportation model, which should be further investigated.</p>

<p>At the first two growth stages in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic>, underground bulbs had the strongest allelopathic effect (Figs <xref rid="pone.0142811.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142811.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), followed by above-ground leaves at the last two growth stages (Figs <xref rid="pone.0142811.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142811.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). More importantly, germination rates induced by aqueous leaf extracts at the increasing bulblet weight stage were significantly improved and reached a maximum rate of 76.7% with increased extract dilutions, which had a similar effect as the synthetic strigolactone analogue GR24 [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142811.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In facts, SLs inducing germination of parastic weeds have been found that contain hydroxy-SLs, such as strigol, orobanchol and sorgomol than non-hydroxy-SLs such as sorgolactone and 5-deoxystrigol [<xref rid="pone.0142811.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>formolongo</italic> leaves may contain more stable water soluble stimulants, having the potential to be processed into green herbicide formulations with wide applications in agriculture production to rapidly deplete the seed bank of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>aegyptiaca</italic> Pers. parasitic weeds in soil.</p>
