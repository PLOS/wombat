        <p>Humanin (HN), a 24-residue peptide, was identified as a novel neuroprotective factor and shows anti-cell death activity against a wide spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cytotoxicities, including exposure to amyloid beta (Abeta), <italic>in vitro</italic>. We previously demonstrated that the injection of S14G-HN, a highly potent HN derivative, into brain ameliorated memory loss in an Abeta-injection mouse model. To fully understand HN's functions under AD-associated pathological conditions, we examined the effect of S14G-HN on triple transgenic mice harboring APP<sub>swe</sub>, tau<sub>P310L</sub>, and PS-1<sub>M146V</sub> that show the age-dependent development of multiple pathologies relating to AD. After 3 months of intranasal treatment, behavioral analyses showed that S14G-HN ameliorated cognitive impairment in male mice. Moreover, ELISA and immunohistochemical analyses showed that Abeta levels in brains were markedly lower in S14G-HN-treated male and female mice than in vehicle control mice. We also found the expression level of neprilysin, an Abeta degrading enzyme, in the outer molecular layer of hippocampal formation was increased in S14G-HN-treated mouse brains. NEP activity was also elevated by S14G-HN treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings suggest that decreased Abeta level in these mice is at least partly attributed to S14G-HN-induced increase of neprilysin level. Although HN was identified as an anti-neuronal death factor, these results indicate that HN may also have a therapeutic effect on amyloid accumulation in AD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Humanin (HN) is a multi-functional 24-residue peptide (amino acid sequence: MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA) whose cDNA was isolated from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient's occipital lobe of brain, a region that remains generally intact in many AD cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto1">[1]</xref> (reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Niikura1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Nishimoto1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Niikura2">[4]</xref>). HN suppresses the neuronal death caused by all AD-related insults so far tested <italic>in vitro</italic> including the key cytotoxic molecule in AD, amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto3">[6]</xref>. HN suppressed cell death caused by Abeta toxicity not only in primary neurons but also in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells, a model of amyloid angiopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Jung1">[7]</xref>. HN is also effective against cell death caused by non-AD-related insults under different experimental settings, such as serum depriviation, prion peptide118-135, IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3), staurosporine etc. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Sponne1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Ikonen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Guo1">[11]</xref>. However, HN is not effective against some insults such as etoposide, suggesting that HN is not a general anti-apoptotic agent.</p>
      <p>It has been hypothesized that HN stimulates its receptor(s) and activates signaling cascade(s) to exert its effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Niikura1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Niikura2">[4]</xref>. Upon HN stimulation, G protein coupled receptors, formyl peptide receptor-like (FPRL) 1 and FPRL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Harada1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Ying1">[13]</xref>, induce increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), while a receptor complex consisting of gp130, CNTFR, and WSX-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto4">[14]</xref> induces activation of a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, three receptor-independent mechanisms have been proposed. (I) Intracellular HN bound to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bax, BimEL, and tBid, and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria, leading to inhibition of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Guo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Zhai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Luciano1">[16]</xref>. (II) HN increased cellular ATP levels in human lymphocytes and a muscular cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya4">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya5">[20]</xref>. (III) Extracellularly added HN was detected in the cells and suppressed apoptosis induced by IGFBP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Ikonen1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Through structure-function analyses, we found that a substitution of Gly for 14th Ser (S14G-HN) increased potency 1000-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto1">[1]</xref>. S14G-HN ameliorated amnesia caused by muscarinic receptor antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Mamiya1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Krejcova1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref> and Abeta in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Miao1">[24]</xref>. S14G-HN also ameliorated symptoms and/or pathology in rodent stroke model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Xu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Xu2">[26]</xref> and diabetes models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hoang1">[28]</xref>. These findings suggest the potential of HN for therapeutic application in AD and other diseases.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the effect of HN derivatives <italic>in vivo</italic>, Abeta injection model was used in the previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Yamada1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Chiba1">[30]</xref>. In this model, Abeta administration induces amnesia in rodents, decreases the number of cholinergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Frautschy1">[31]</xref>, and reduces choline acetyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Yamaguchi1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Yamada2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Nitta1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Nitta2">[35]</xref> Although the Abeta injection model is a simple and convenient model, the transgenic mouse model has some advantages, for instance production of multiple Abeta species through physiological process and amyloid plaque formation. The triple transgenic mice harboring APP<sub>swe</sub>, tau<sub>P310L</sub>, and PS-1<sub>M146V</sub> (3xTg-AD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Oddo1">[36]</xref> have the advantage of the age-dependent development of multiple pathological events relating to AD. In these mice, memory impairment was observed by Morris water maze test at 9 months of age. Soluble Abeta was observed from 9 months of age and plaques from 14 months by immunohistochemical analyses. They also develop tau pathology: total tau protein increased age-dependently, correlating with a decrease of soluble tau and an increase of insoluble tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-HirataFukae1">[37]</xref>. Therefore, they are beneficial to examine the effect of therapeutic candidates on pathological changes under the complex physiological conditions.</p>
      <p>We previously demonstrated that Abeta-induced amnesia was suppressed by intracerebroventricular injection of S14G-HN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref>. To fully understand HN's functions on complex AD-relevant pathology, in this study, we used triple transgenic mouse model. We found that S14G-HN ameliorated cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice and reduced amyloid burden accompanied by an increase in neprilysin level in the hippocampal region.</p>

        <p>Triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice were housed under 12 hour light, 12 hour dark cycles with food and water provided ad libitum. Male and female 3xTg-AD mice (n = 9 in each group) at the age of 13 months (13.2±0.6) were treated intranasally with 10 nmol of S14G-HN (Peptide Institute, Japan) or vehicle (water) for 3 and half months. Treatment was carried out 5 days a week (weekdays) for the initial 2.5 months and everyday during the last 1 month. After 3 months of treatment, 7 male and 9 female mice in the vehicle control group and 9 male and 7 female mice in the S14G-HN treatment group were subjected to behavioral analyses. After 1 week of the last behavioral test (24 hours after the last treatment), mice at 17 months of age were sacrificed by cervical dislocation as described in Planel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Planel1">[38]</xref>. Half hemispheres of the brains were rapidly frozen for immunoblot and ELISA analyses and the other half hemispheres were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analyses. To examine the delivery of S14G-HN to brain, 3xTg-AD mice (female, 20 months of age) were treated intranasally with 10 nmol of S14G-HN or vehicle (water). After 1 hour of administration, mice were sacrificed and brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analyses. All experimental procedures were approved by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #07-016).</p>

A circular, white escape platform (diameter 10 cm) was submerged 1 cm below the water surface, 30 cm off the rim of the pool. Training trials, 120 sec each, were performed twice a day during 5 consecutive days. The platform location and the animal's starting point were held constant within each pair of daily tests, but the location of the platform and the animal's starting point were rotated by 90° every day. The mice were allowed to stay on the platform for 20 sec before and after each trial. On the fifth day, a probe test was preformed after the second daily trial. The platform was removed from the maze and swimming behavior was recorded for 2 min. Mice were then subjected to a visible platform test. A black escape platform was placed at 1cm above the water in the same place in training trials in the 5th day. Each mouse was released into the water and the time taken to find the platform was recorded (maximum 60 seconds). Animals that did not climb on the platform during this test were excluded from the statistical analysis. All behavior was recorded and analyzed by TopScan software.</p>

        <p>To examine the effect of HN, we designed a 3-month treatment study using male and female 3xTg-AD mice (n = 9 in each group) at the early plaque-bearing stage. Since the progression of Abeta pathology in our colony is slower than that in the original colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-HirataFukae1">[37]</xref>, we started the treatment of mice at the age of 13 months (13.2±0.6).

To achieve approximately 1nM of concentration in CNS, we chose a dose of S14G-HN at 10 nmol/day, based on the finding that intranasal administration of 5 nmol [<sup>125</sup>I]-IGF-I resulted in 0.32–1.44 nM of concentration in CNS region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Thorne1">[51]</xref>.

In the Open Field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g002">Fig. 2A–C</xref>), no significant difference was observed between the vehicle and S14G-HN treated mice in total moving distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g002">Fig.2A</xref>), walking speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g002">Fig.2B</xref>), and time spent in peripheral area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g002">Fig.2C</xref>).

        <title>S14G-HN ameliorates deficit in spatial learning and memory in 3xTg-AD mice</title>
        <p>In the Morris water maze test, training trials (2 min each) were performed twice a day for 5 days. To assess flexible learning ability, the position of the platform was rotated everyday. The parameter of learning flexibility was analyzed by looking at the block of first trials performed each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). S14G-HN treated male mice showed a trend of shorter latency than control on the second day. In female mice, no significant difference was observed between S14G-HN-treated and control mice. On the fifth day, the probe test was performed after the second daily trial. Time spent in each quadrant of pool was significantly different in S14G-HN treated male mice but not in vehicle control male mice by non-parametric ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Post-hoc test on values of S14G-HN-treated male mice detected a significant difference between platform quadrant and opposite quadrant (p&lt;0.05).

These results show that S14G-HN-treated male mice stayed close to the platform location longer than vehicle control mice, suggesting better cognitive and memory function of S14G-HN-treated mice than control. We also measured the duration that mice spent in the platform location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). In the first 30 sec of probe test, S14G-HN-treated male mice stayed in the platform area significantly longer than control male mice.

        <title>Abeta level was reduced in brain of S14G-HN-treated 3xTg-AD mice</title>
        <p>Since Abeta pathology may correlate to cognitive function, we examined the levels of Abeta in brain from 3xTg-AD mice treated with S14G-HN or vehicle by ELISA. Total Abeta40 in vehicle control, both male and female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> grey columns), showed levels consistent with the expected age-dependent increase of Abeta in naïve mice reported in Hirata-Fukae et al. (2008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> dotted lines). Compared with vehicle control, the levels of Abeta40 in S14G-HN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> black columns) were markedly low in both male and female mice, though statistical significance was detected only in females. A similar trend was observed in soluble Abeta40 levels in both genders, though the difference was not significant (data not shown). We also performed ELISA to detect total Abeta42. Since Abeta42 level is still low at this age of 3xTg-AD mice, many samples resulted in undetectable level: 2 out of 7 vehicle male, 6 out of 9 S14G-HN-treated male, none of vehicle female, and 5 out of 7 S14G-HN-treated female mice showed undetectable level of Abeta42. Given zero as a value of these undetectable samples, Abeta42 levels (mean±SE, pmol/g tissue) were vehicle male (n = 7); 6.5±3.9, S14G-HN male (n = 9); 3.8±2.1, vehicle female (n = 9); 46.0±20.4, S14G-HN female (n = 7); 10.4±6.7. P values of t-test were 0.54 and 0.007 for male and female, respectively. These results indicate that Abeta42 level had a trend similar to that of Abeta40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), i.e. decreased level of Abeta in S14G-HN-treated mice.</p>

        <p>To confirm the finding obtained by ELISA, we examined the amount of amyloid plaques by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-Abeta antibody 82E1, which specifically recognizes Abeta but not APP. Representative results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4B–G</xref>. We stained six sections per mouse at 150 µm intervals and evaluated the number of plaques (count), total area, and integrated density of staining in subiculum region of each section (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016259-t001">Table 1</xref>). Both total area and integrated density were significantly lower in S14G-HN-treated 3xTg-AD female mice than the vehicle control. The similar trend was observed in male mice as in female. As observed in the results of ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), no statistical significance was detected in males because of large individual variations (data not shown).

        <p>To understand how S14G-HN suppresses Abeta accumulation, we next examined the levels of full-length APP and sAPPalpha, a cleaved product of alpha-secretase. We performed immunoblot analysis of brain homogenate using antibodies that specifically recognize C-terminal regions of APP and sAPPalpha, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed no significant difference in levels of full-length APP and sAPPalpha between S14G-HN and vehicle treated mice (number of animals; vehicle male = 7, female = 9, S14G-HN male = 9, female = 7): relative intensity of full-length APP and sAPPalpha bands in S14G-HN-treated brain homogenate (indicated as percentage of corresponding vehicle control, mean±SD) was 98±17 (male), 106±15 (female) and 81±15 (male), 98±16 (female), respectively. In addition, we detected no difference in sAPPbeta level between S14G-HN and vehicle control (data not shown). These results suggest that S14G-HN altered neither APP production nor processing by secretases.</p>

We performed immunohistochemical staining of brain sections using anti-NEP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6A–F</xref>). To evaluate the staining results quantitatively, we measured staining intensity of the middle and outer molecular layers. The raw values of measured staining intensity of outer molecular layer of vehicle and S14G-HN-treated mice (arbitrary units, mean±SD) were 38.2±12.0 (male), 37.5±6.4 (female) and 40.5±7.0 (male), 38.6±4.8 (female), respectively. To normalize the variation in overall staining intensity of sections, the ratio of staining intensity (outer layer/middle layer) was calculated.

        <title>S14G-HN did not affect tau phosphorylation in 3xTg-AD mice</title>
        <p>A major characteristic of 3xTg-AD mice is age-dependent progression of tau pathology. We thus examined the effect of S14G-HN on tau pathology. Phosphorylation of tau protein was assessed by immunoblot using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (AT8, AT180, and AT270 for Ser208, Thr231, and Thr181, respectively). Total tau was assessed by tau46 antibody. The level of total tau (normalized by actin) was not changed by S14G-HN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g007">Fig. 7A,B</xref>). The relative intensity of bands in S14G-HN-treated mouse brain homogenate (percentage of corresponding vehicle control, mean±SD) was 100±21 (male) and 112±17 (female). The ratio of phosphorylated tau (Ser202) to total tau was not different between S14G-HN treated and control mice: the value of S14G-HN calculated as percentage of corresponding vehicle control (mean±SD) was 101±39 (male) and 95±23 (female). No significant difference between S14G-HN treated and control mice was detected in phosphorylation of Thr231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) and Thr181 (data not shown).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study demonstrated that 3-month treatment of a highly potent HN derivative S14G-HN suppressed the deterioration of cognitive and memory functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), synaptic degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) and the increase in amyloid burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016259-t001">Table 1</xref>) in 3xTg-AD mice. Since Abeta, particularly soluble Abeta oligomers, have been demonstrated to induce synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Selkoe1">[57]</xref>, the improved cognitive function by S14G-HN may be at least partly attributed to the reduced Abeta level in S14G-HN-treated mouse brains. The pro-cholinergic effect of HN might also contribute to the S14G-HN-induced cognitive benefit, since HN ameliorates amnesia caused by muscarinic receptor antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Mamiya1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Krejcova1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref>. Although reduced Abeta level in brains of S14G-HN-treated mice was confirmed by both ELISA and immunohistological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016259-t001">Table 1</xref>), no significant change was observed in levels of full-length APP, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta in whole brain homogenates of these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This indicates that S14G-HN does not modulate APP production or secretase activities <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the other hand, we observed higher levels of NEP in the outer molecular layer of hippocampal formation in S14G-HN-treated mice than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6A–G</xref>), while IDE levels were not affected by S14G-HN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6H–K</xref>). NEP activity was also elevated by S14G-HN treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6L</xref>). These observations suggest that the higher level of NEP in some brain regions contributes to the reduced Abeta level in brains of S14G-HN-treated mice. The molecular layer of dentate gyrus comprises the dendrites and axons arising from the entorhinal cortex and the intrinsic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Treves1">[58]</xref>, indicating this region is susceptible to Abeta toxicity. In fact, soluble Abeta interfered with long-term potentiation in CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Walsh1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Wang1">[60]</xref> and spine density is decreased in the outer layer of the dentate gyrus of AD mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Irizarry1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Jacobsen1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, the reduction of Abeta level in the molecular layer through increase in local NEP levels may contribute to S14G-HN-dependent amelioration of memory impairment in 3xTg-AD mice.</p>
      <p>A behavioral test demonstrated that S14G-HN rescued cognitive function in 3xTg-AD male mice, whereas it showed a less clear effect in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The difference in HN's effect between genders may be attributed to the difference in the stage of Abeta pathology, because 3xTg-AD female mice showed more aggressive Abeta pathology than male mice in the plaque-bearing stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-HirataFukae1">[37]</xref>. Namely, S14G-HN can induce high enough NEP levels to reduce Abeta level for preserving cognitive function in the early Abeta accumulating stage, while it was not enough in the advanced plaque-bearing stage.</p>
      <p>HN-like molecule was detected in non-CNS organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kariya2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima2">[46]</xref>, and the level of HN in serum was decreased age-dependently in human and rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>. Given that the systemic administration of S14G-HN showed an effect similar to that of intracerebroventricular injection of S14G-HN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Krejcova1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Xu1">[25]</xref>, it is hypothesized that HN circulated in blood stream is transferred into brain by a so far unidentified mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Niikura2">[4]</xref>, and that serum level of HN correlates to the level and effectiveness of HN in brain. It is interesting to note that the NEP level in outer molecular layer is decreased by aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Iwata1">[47]</xref>. Taken together with our finding of NEP levels in outer molecular layer of hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), age-dependent decrease in endogenous HN levels associated with low NEP expression may be linked to increased risk for progression of AD by aging.</p>
      <p>This study showed that both total amount and phosphorylation status of tau were unaffected by S14G-HN treatment in 3xTg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that HN has no effect on tau pathology. In 3xTg-AD mice, tau pathology becomes apparent between 12 to 15 months of age and staining with PHF1 antibody, a marker of late stage of tau pathology, is evident at 18 months of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Oddo1">[36]</xref>.

The cognitive decline was reversed by Abeta immunotherapy in young 3xTg-AD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Billings1">[63]</xref>, indicating that the reduction of soluble Abeta level is sufficient for the prevention of memory impairment in the early stage of Abeta pathology. However, in aged 3xTg-AD mice with advanced Abeta and tau pathologies, reduction of soluble Abeta alone did not improve the cognitive phenotype, while reduction of both soluble Abeta and soluble tau ameliorated cognitive deficit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Oddo2">[64]</xref>. We performed behavioral tests with these mice at 16 to 17 months of age, which corresponds to mid-stage of tau pathology. It is thus possible that progressing tau pathology contributed to cognitive decline in these mice, and that the lack in the effect of S14G-HN on tau pathology may be a reason for the lack in significant effect of S14G-HN on behavioral tests in female mice, which carry advanced Abeta burden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-HirataFukae1">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, in the transgenic mice with human P301S mutant tau, synaptic dysfunction and its loss were detected prior to the appearance of fibrillary tau, indicating that soluble tau causes these manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Yoshiyama1">[65]</xref>. In our study, S14G-HN-treated female mice showed potentially better cognitive functions, though not statistically significant, compared to the vehicle-treated male mice despite of the similar levels of Abeta in these two groups of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g003">Figs. 3</xref> C,D, 4A). If soluble tau contributes to the cognitive impairment of 3xTg-AD mice at this pathological stage, S14G-HN might have certain antagonistic effects on soluble tau-induced cognitive dysfunction in addition to that induced by Abeta. Alternative interpretation is that systemic effects of S14G-HN may contribute to the improvement of cognitive functions. Halagappa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Halagappa1">[66]</xref> showed that intermittent fasting improved cognitive functions of 3xTg-AD mice without reducing phospho-tau levels and proposed that dietary manipulation increases the resistance of neurons to the adverse effects of tau pathology. HN injected in brains of rats modulates glucose metabolism by improving hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>. It is, thus, possible that S14G-HN might have similar systemic effects as dietary manipulation. Moreover, several studies suggest that insulin resistance may increase the risk of AD through multiple mechanisms including increases in Abeta and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Citron1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Craft1">[68]</xref>. Therefore, an action mechanism of HN that ameliorates insulin resistance and hyperglycemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref> may contribute to beneficial effects of HN on AD-related pathologies.</p>
      <p>Previous studies demonstrated that several signaling molecules are involved in HN's activities <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. STAT3 and related kinase(s) are involved in the anti-neuronal death activities of HN <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto4">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto5">[56]</xref> and activated <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Yamada3">[69]</xref>. In addition to anti-cell death effects, these kinases are also involved in the antagonizing effect of HN against amnesia caused by muscarinic receptor blockade <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Tajima1">[23]</xref>. STAT3 contributes to the effect of HN on peripheral insulin action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Muzumdar1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hoang1">[28]</xref>. ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways are implicated in neuroprotection of HN against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Xu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Xu2">[26]</xref>. p38 and STAT3 are involved in apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal in human leukemia cell line and pancreatic beta-cell line, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hoang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Wang2">[70]</xref>. In this study, we did not detect significant changes in phosphorylation of Tyr705 in STAT3 and Ser473 in Akt, while phosphorylation of Thr308 in Akt was significantly increased in S14G-HN-treaed 3xTg-AD mouse brains compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Since full activation of Akt requires dual phosphorylation on both Ser473 and Thr308 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Franke1">[71]</xref>, these findings are insufficient to prove the involvement of PI3K-Akt pathway in HN-mediated neuroprotection in 3xTg-AD mice. Considering that PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1), a major kinase for phosphorylation of Thr308 in Akt, plays an indispensable role in Akt-independent cell survival signaling pathway induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Kharebava1">[72]</xref>, it is speculated that S14G-HN may activate the PDK1-mediated neuroprotective mechanism. In contrast, lack of increased STAT3 activation in S14G-HN-treated mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) is inconsistent with previous findings that STAT3 has an essential role in the neuroprotecitve effect of HN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Hashimoto5">[56]</xref>. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that S14G-HN-induced activation of STAT3 (and Akt) was transient and thus we could not detect them, since we sacrificed mice 24 hours after the last treatment.</p>
      <p>In this study, we observed that S14G-HN increased region-specific NEP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). NEP expression is regulated by APP C-terminal fragment, AICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-PardossiPiquard1">[73]</xref>. Since S14G-HN did not change APP production and processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), S14G-HN may not affect this mechanism, unless region/cell-specific effect exists. Rather, HN may evoke other unidentified mechanisms to modulate NEP expression. In fact, since NEP levels are substantially reduced but not diminished in presenilin-deficient mice, it is hypothesized that there is an AICD-independent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-PardossiPiquard1">[73]</xref>. On the other hand, we also observed that S14G-HN increased NEP activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g006">Fig. 6L</xref>). NEP activity in primary neurons was unaffected by treatment with MAPK inhibitor as well as stimulation with insulin and IL-6, which are related to Akt and STAT3 pathways, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Saito1">[74]</xref>, suggesting that these signaling pathways do not play essential roles in modulation of NEP activity. Somatostatin is a NEP modulator and enhances NEP activity via activation of somatostatin receptor coupled with G-protein, Gi/o <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Saito1">[74]</xref>. Since HN receptor FPRL1 is coupled with Gi/o, downstream signaling cascade(s) of this receptor may play an important role in NEP regulation. Further detailed studies will be necessary to understand signaling events evoked by S14G-HN in 3xTg-AD mice, especially pathways/molecules involved in the Abeta-lowering effect.</p>
      <p>Regarding AD-linked pathological features, previous studies revealed that HN suppresses Abeta-induced neuronal death <italic>in vitro</italic> and ameliorated amnesia caused by Abeta and muscarinic receptor antagonists <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition to these functions, this study showed S14G-HN decreased Abeta burden in 3xTg-AD mice, which is an additional <italic>in vivo</italic> function of HN as a countermeasure against AD. We also showed that decreased Abeta levels were associated with increased NEP levels in hippocampal formation of 3xTg-AD mouse brains, suggesting that HN is a NEP modulator.</p>
      <p>Considering that intranasal administration is practically feasible for clinical application, we chose intranasal treatment over systemic methods in this study. Since the lack of significant findings in some experiments, for instance memory retention in Novel object recognition task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016259-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), might be attributed to suboptimal dosing, further studies will be necessary for pharmacological development. However, the present study contributes to the preclinical evidence that intranasal administration of HN represents a potential symptomatic and disease-modifying intervention in AD. We note that the intranasal administration route has been shown to provide effective delivery of peptides to the central nervous system in humans. Further, a recent preliminary study demonstrated cognitive benefits with intranasal administration of another peptide, AL-108 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0016259-Gozes1">[75]</xref>. Additional preclinical mechanistic and toxicological studies of HN are thus warranted, and could lead to clinical studies of this peptide in AD.</p>
