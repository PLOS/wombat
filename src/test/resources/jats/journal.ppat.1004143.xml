<abstract>
<p>Metazoans protect themselves from environmental toxins and virulent pathogens through detoxification and immune responses. We previously identified a small molecule xenobiotic toxin that extends survival of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> infected with human bacterial pathogens by activating the conserved p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 host defense pathway. Here we investigate the cellular mechanisms that couple activation of a detoxification response to innate immunity. From an RNAi screen of 1,420 genes expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine, we identified the conserved Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 and 28 other gene inactivations that abrogate the induction of PMK-1-dependent immune effectors by this small molecule. We demonstrate that MDT-15/MED15 is required for the xenobiotic-induced expression of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune genes and protection from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection. We also show that MDT-15 controls the induction of detoxification genes and functions to protect the host from bacteria-derived phenazine toxins. These data define a central role for MDT-15/MED15 in the coordination of xenobiotic detoxification and innate immune responses.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Metazoans respond to environmental threats in part through conserved pathways that coordinate protective transcriptional responses. During infection with an invasive pathogen, for example, innate immune pathways regulate the secretion of antimicrobial immune effectors. Likewise, exposure to toxic molecules leads to the induction of detoxification mechanisms that protect the host from the deleterious effects of these compounds. Here we find that a conserved transcriptional regulator MDT-15/MED15 links xenobiotic detoxification and immune responses in a manner that is important for protection during bacterial infection. We also show that MDT-15/MED15 is necessary for the host to resist the lethal effects of secreted toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria. Rapid coordination of these protective host responses through MDT-15/MED15 may therefore be part of a conserved survival strategy in the wild.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In nature, organisms encounter environmental insults, such as chemical toxins, secreted microbial virulence factors and invasive pathogens, that threaten their ability to survive and reproduce. As a result, metazoans have evolved protective pathways to counter these challenges. For example, gene families such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UDPs) detoxify xenobiotic small molecule toxins and are conserved from nematodes to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Lindblom1">[1]</xref>. Likewise, innate immune defenses provide protection from invasive pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley1">[2]</xref>. Recent publications have suggested that recognition of xenobiotic toxins is involved in the activation of immune response pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Melo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Runkel1">[4]</xref>. From an evolutionary perspective, it is logical that hosts respond to threats encountered in the wild at least in part through surveillance pathways that monitor the integrity of core cellular machinery, which are often the targets of xenobiotic small molecules or microbe-generated toxins. These studies predict that organisms may integrate detoxification and immune responses as a means to respond rapidly to such challenges, but the mechanisms underlying this coordinated host response have not been reported.</p>
<p>Our research group and others use bacterial and fungal pathogenesis assays in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to investigate mechanisms of immune pathway activation in intestinal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley1">[2]</xref>. Genetic analyses of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are hypersusceptible to bacterial infection have revealed that the nematode mounts defense responses through evolutionarily conserved innate immune pathways. For example, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) kinase pathway, orthologous to the ASK1 (MAP kinase kinase kinase)/MKK3/6 (MAP kinase kinase)/p38 (MAP kinase) pathway in mammals, is required for protection against pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Kim1">[5]</xref>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals carrying loss-of-function mutations in this pathway have defects in the basal and pathogen-induced expression of immune effectors and are hypersusceptible to killing by bacterial and fungal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Kim1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously used a <italic>C. elegans</italic> pathogenesis assay as a means to identify small molecules that protect the host during bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Moy1">[8]</xref>. One of the compounds identified in this screen, a small molecule called RPW-24, extended the survival of nematodes infected with the human bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> by stimulating the host immune response via the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. A genome-wide microarray analysis of animals exposed to RPW-24 revealed that, in addition to inducing the transcription of putative immune effectors, this molecule also strongly upregulated Phase I and Phase II detoxification enzymes (CYPs, GSTs and UDPs), suggesting that RPW-24 is a xenobiotic toxin to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Consistent with this hypothesis, RPW-24 caused a dose dependent reduction of nematode lifespan on nonpathogenic food and delayed development of animals that were exposed starting at the first larval stage.</p>
<p>Here we sought to use RPW-24 as a tool to characterize mechanisms of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway activation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that activation of PMK-1-regulated pathogen response genes is genetically linked to the induction of genes involved in the detoxification of small molecule toxins. We show that the evolutionarily conserved Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 is required for the induction of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-mediated immune effectors as well as non-PMK-1-dependent detoxification genes by RPW-24. These data demonstrate that the host response to a xenobiotic involves coordination of detoxification and innate immune responses via the Mediator subunit MDT-15. Moreover, loss of MDT-15 function has important physiological effects on the ability of an animal to mount protective immune responses, resist bacterial infection and survive challenge from lethal bacterial toxins.</p>

<title>RNAi Screen Identifies Regulators of p38 MAP Kinase PMK-1-Dependent Genes</title>
<p>To investigate mechanisms of immune activation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we generated a GFP transcriptional reporter for the immune response gene <italic>F08G5.6</italic>. <italic>F08G5.6</italic> is a putative immune effector that contains a CUB-like domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Troemel1">[6]</xref> and is transcriptionally induced by exposure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to several bacterial pathogens, including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Troemel1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Bolz1">[10]</xref>.

<p>The level of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> induction during bacterial infection is dependent upon the virulence of the invading pathogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We exposed <italic>C. elegans</italic> to several <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains, each of which was previously shown to have a different pathogenic potential toward nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Lee1">[13]</xref> and used qRT-PCR to determine the expression levels of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> in these animals. In general, more pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains caused significantly greater induction of <italic>F08G5.6</italic>, suggesting that some aspect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence, rather than a structural feature of the bacteria itself, causes the activation of <italic>F08G5.6</italic>. Consistent with these data, it was previously shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> primarily responds to virulence-related cues to mount its innate immune defenses towards <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Estes1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Dunbar1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>To identify genes that regulate the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway in response to RPW-24, we screened a library of RNAi clones corresponding to 1,420 genes expressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal epithelium (approximately 9% of the genome, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s007">Table S1B</xref>) for gene inactivations that abrogated the RPW-24-mediated induction of <italic>pF08G5.6::GFP</italic>. We specifically focused on intestinally expressed genes because of the recognized role for intestinal cells in coordinating the host response to ingested pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Shivers2">[17]</xref>, and because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and RPW-24 induce <italic>F08G5.6</italic> expression in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Our initial screening effort identified 153 genes that, when inactivated by RNAi, diminished or abrogated the induction of <italic>pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> by RPW-24.</p>
<p>We took several steps to identify specific regulators of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors among these 153 gene inactivations. First, we noticed that knockdown of many of these genes markedly slowed nematode growth. To eliminate genes that simply reduced GFP reporter expression as a consequence of pleiotropic effects on worm growth and development, we determined if these 153 gene inactivations also affected induction of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> immune reporter <italic>irg-1::GFP</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Estes1">[14]</xref>. <italic>irg-1</italic> is strongly upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection or by an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that expresses the bacterial virulence factor Exotoxin A (ToxA), but via a pathway independent of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Estes1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Dunbar1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, RPW-24 does not cause the induction of <italic>irg-1::GFP</italic> and mutation of the <italic>zip-2</italic> gene, which encodes the transcription factor that regulates <italic>irg-1</italic> expression, does not affect the RPW-24-mediated induction of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> (data not shown) or alter the ability of RPW-24 to extend the survival time of nematodes infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. We therefore discarded the genes that, when inactivated, reduced the induction of <italic>irg-1::GFP</italic> by <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing ToxA, reasoning that they were unlikely to be specific regulators of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent pathogen response genes. Using this approach, we selected 56 of the 153 genes for further study.</p>
<p>In a tertiary screen, we determined the effects of these 56 gene inactivations on <italic>pF35E12.5::GFP</italic>, a second immune reporter that is also strongly induced in the intestine by RPW-24 in a PMK-1-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Bolz1">[10]</xref>. 29 of the 56 RNAi clones reduced or eliminated the induction of both the <italic>pF35E12.5::GFP</italic> and <italic>pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> reporters by RPW-24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s007">Table S1A</xref>). Validating the screen, the 29 clones we identified as putative regulators of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent genes included the three known components of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway that were present in the screening library, which suggested that the screen could identify additional, unrecognized components of this signaling pathway.</p>
<p>To confirm further the results of the screen, we used RNAi to knockdown the expression of a representative sample of the 29 genes identified, and tested the induction levels of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> and <italic>F35E12.5</italic> by RPW-24 with qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s007">Table S1A</xref>). For all six genes tested, we verified that inactivation of the gene by RNAi dramatically reduced the induction levels of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-regulated genes <italic>F08G5.6</italic> and <italic>F35E12.5</italic>.</p>

<title>Mediator Subunit MDT-15/MED15 Regulates p38 MAP Kinase PMK-1 Pathway-Dependent Genes</title>
<p>One of the strongest hits from our RNAi screen was <italic>mdt-15</italic>, which encodes a subunit of the Mediator complex homologous to mammalian MED15 (78% sequence identity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Yang1">[20]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>mdt-15</italic> eliminated all visible expression of the <italic>pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> and <italic>pF35E12.5::GFP</italic> reporters, and reduced expression of these genes by at least two orders of magnitude in response to RPW-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s007">Table S1</xref>). MDT-15 was previously found to regulate the transcription of detoxification genes, including cytochrome P450s, glutathione-s-transferases, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert2">[19]</xref>, gene classes that are strongly induced by RPW-24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. To study the role of <italic>mdt-15</italic> in the regulation of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 gene activation, we crossed the <italic>pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> reporter into the hypomorphic <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> allele, which was previously shown to recapitulate many of the phenotypes observed in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Goh1">[21]</xref>. As in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals, we observed no induction of GFP when <italic>mdt-15(tm2182); pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> animals were exposed to RPW-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). An extrachromosomal array containing wild-type <italic>mdt-15</italic> under its own promoter partially restored RPW-24-induced GFP expression in <italic>mdt-15(tm2182);pF08G5.6::GFP</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if MDT-15 is required for the induction of other RPW-24-induced genes, we used NanoString nCounter gene expression analysis to generate transcription profiles of 118 <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes with known involvement in immune, stress and detoxification responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s008">Table S2</xref>).

<p>Consistent with a role for MDT-15 in the expression of PMK-1 activated genes, the NanoString analysis revealed that the RPW-24-dependent induction of 10 of the 13 PMK-1-dependent genes was abrogated in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref> bottom panel). We used qRT-PCR to show that <italic>mdt-15</italic> was knocked down by RNAi in this experiment and to confirm that <italic>mdt-15</italic> depletion caused a dramatic reduction in the RPW-24-induced expression of three <italic>pmk-1</italic>-dependent immune genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Further, we found that the RPW-24-mediated induction levels of these three immune genes was reduced in the <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> mutant, which recapitulated our findings in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Knockdown of <italic>mdt-15</italic> reduced the expression of the top five most strongly upregulated p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors by several orders of magnitude (<italic>C32H11.1</italic>, <italic>F35E12.5</italic>, <italic>F08G5.6</italic>, <italic>F49F1.7</italic>, and <italic>F49F1.1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref> top panel). These five genes were still induced by RPW-24 in <italic>pmk-1(km25)</italic> loss-of-function animals, albeit to levels markedly lower than in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref> top panel), but their induction was entirely abrogated by knockdown of <italic>mdt-15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref> bottom panel). These data suggest that MDT-15 coordinates inputs from PMK-1 and other immune signaling pathway(s) to modulate the expression of these p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent putative immune effectors. We also identified a requirement for <italic>mdt-15</italic> in the induction of five putative immune effectors (<italic>clec-206</italic>, <italic>C29F7.2</italic>, <italic>K05B2.4</italic>, <italic>cdr-1</italic>, <italic>T28C12.4</italic>) that are not transcriptional targets of the PMK-1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref>, compare top and bottom panels). Thus, MDT-15 is required for the induction of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune genes and a second group of defense effectors that are independent of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>The p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway plays an important role in the regulation of putative immune effectors during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Troemel1">[6]</xref>. To determine whether MDT-15/MED15 is also involved in the regulation of these genes during bacterial infection, we infected <italic>C. elegans</italic> with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 for 8 hours and used qRT-PCR to compare the induction levels of several immune response genes in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> and control animals. The basal and pathogen-induced expression of three p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors (<italic>C32H11.1</italic>, <italic>F08G5.6</italic> and <italic>F35E12.5</italic>) was reduced in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals by one to three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We also tested the induction levels of three genes whose transcription is activated during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in a manner independent of PMK-1 (<italic>irg-1, irg-2</italic> and <italic>F01D5.5</italic>) and found that PMK-1-independent immune effectors were induced in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection to levels comparable to that observed in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>One possible explanation for these observations is that the Mediator subunit MDT-15 is a general regulator of transcription that non-specifically affects the expression of a large number of genes. In the NanoString experiment, however, we identified 10 genes that were induced by RPW-24 in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals to levels similar to the wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g002">Figure 2</xref> bottom panel). Also of note, our secondary screen demonstrated that <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> had no effect on the induction of <italic>irg-1::GFP</italic> by ToxA. We further wondered if the defects in expression of the PMK-1 targets in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals were due to direct transcriptional regulation of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway components by MDT-15. However, we found that the mRNA levels of <italic>pmk-1</italic>, <italic>tir-1</italic> and <italic>sek-1</italic> in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals were not different from the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the data in this section indicate that MDT-15 is required for the transcriptional activation of immune effectors controlled by the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1, and at least one other pathway. However, MDT-15 is not required for the induction of all defense-related genes.</p>

<title>The Mediator Subunit MDT-15 Acts Downstream of the p38 MAP Kinase PMK-1 to Regulate the Induction of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> and <italic>F35E12.5</italic></title>
<p>To determine if MDT-15 acts genetically upstream or downstream of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 in coordinating the induction of immune effectors during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, we utilized the MAP kinase phosphatase VHP-1, which is a negative regulator of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Kim2">[24]</xref>.

<title>Mediator Subunit MDT-15/MED15 Is Required for Defense against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Infection</title>
<p>The experiments in the preceding sections show that the Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 is necessary for the induction of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-regulated genes, both in response to RPW-24 and during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. We therefore reasoned that mutation or RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>mdt-15</italic> would result in enhanced susceptibility to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection.

<p>We also found that the ability of RPW-24 to extend survival of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-infected wild-type and sterile nematodes was significantly attenuated in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals compared to controls, suggesting that MDT-15 is required for the immunostimulatory activity of RPW-24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s003">Figure S3A and S3C</xref>). The degree of lifespan extension by RPW-24 during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection was reduced in <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> compared to controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.09)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).

<p>One caveat concerning the observation that <italic>mdt-15</italic> depleted animals are hypersusceptible to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection is that <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> animals have a reduced lifespan when grown on the normal laboratory food source <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 compared to wild-type controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert2">[19]</xref>. Several observations indicate, however, that MDT-15 is an important modulator of nematode survival during bacterial infection. First, we have shown above that <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals fail to upregulate p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors both in response to a xenobiotic toxin and during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, but retain the ability to induce other immune genes in response to pathogens and following exposure to the bacterial toxin ToxA. In addition, <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals do not respond to the immunostimulatory effects of RPW-24. We have shown previously that <italic>C. elegans</italic> with mutations in the ZIP-1 and FSHR-1 immune pathways, which act in parallel to the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 cassette, are hypersusceptible to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, but retain the ability to respond to RPW-24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. That <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals are blind to the immunostimulatory effects of RPW-24 suggests a specific role of MDT-15 in regulating p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway activity. It is also important to note that despite their reduced lifespan, <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals are not sensitive to all environmental insults. For example, animals deficient in <italic>mdt-15</italic> are sensitive to the toxin fluoranthene, but not β-naphthoflavone, and are not more sensitive to high temperatures than wild-type animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert2">[19]</xref>.</p>

<p>Given that MDT-15 is required for the regulation of detoxification genes and the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway, we wondered if the detoxification machinery in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is regulated by the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1. We found, however, that 12 of the 13 RPW-24-induced detoxification genes were upregulated in <italic>pmk-1(km25)</italic> null mutants to levels comparable to that in wild-type animals exposed to RPW-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004143-g006">Figure 6A</xref> bottom panel). We used qRT-PCR to confirm this observation for three cytochrome P450 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Thus, the MDT-15-dependent xenobiotic detoxification program is induced in a manner independent of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1.</p>

<title>MDT-15/MED15 Is Not Required for the Avoidance Behavior Induced by RPW-24</title>
<p>Many xenobiotic toxins, including RPW-24, induce an avoidance response wherein <italic>C. elegans</italic> leave a lawn of bacterial food, to which they are otherwise attracted, if it contains a toxic compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Melo1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. We therefore wondered if MDT-15 is required for the avoidance behavior induced by RPW-24. However, <italic>pmk-1(km25)</italic> and <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> animals left the lawn of <italic>E. coli</italic> containing RPW-24 as readily as wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We also observed a similar phenotype when we knocked down the expression of <italic>pmk-1</italic> and <italic>mdt-15</italic> in the neuronally-sensitive RNAi strain TU3311 (data not shown). Thus, animals lacking the function of MDT-15 and PMK-1 are still able to recognize RPW-24 as a toxin.</p>
<p>In summary, the data in this and the preceding section suggest that MDT-15, but not PMK-1, controls the induction of genes that are required to resist the toxic effects of RPW-24, and that neither are required for avoidance of RPW-24.</p>

<title>Mediator Subunit MDT-15/MED15 Promotes Resistance to Secreted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Phenazine Toxins</title>
<p>We have shown that MDT-15 regulates the <italic>C. elegans</italic> detoxification response to the xenobiotic RPW-24. We therefore hypothesized that MDT-15 might also be required for protection from lethal secreted toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria. To address this question, we used an assay that allows the specific study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> killing by secreted low molecular weight toxins of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. When <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is grown on high osmolarity media, phenazine toxins produced by the bacteria are lethal to nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Cezairliyan1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-MahajanMiklos1">[29]</xref>.

Wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> at the fourth larval stage of development, but not young adult animals, are exquisitely sensitive to the phenazine toxins produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in this assay and are killed within 6 hours of exposure. We took advantage of the inherent resistance of young adult animals to test whether <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> animals are hypersusceptible to the phenazine toxins produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. As expected, both wild-type and <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> L4 animals were rapidly killed by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the “fast kill” assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> carrying deletions of both phenazine biosynthetic operons (<italic>Δphz</italic>) does not make these toxins and accordingly had reduced ability to kill both wild-type and <italic>mdt-15(tm2182)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004143.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Detecting and countering environmental threats is central to the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce in the wild. We examined the <italic>C. elegans</italic> response to the xenobiotic RPW-24, which is able to induce a host immune response that is protective for animals infected with the lethal bacterial pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. In an RNAi screen with RPW-24, we identified a number of genes, including <italic>mdt-15/MED15</italic>, which are required for induction of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors. <italic>mdt-15</italic> encodes a subunit of the highly conserved Mediator complex that controls the activation of a variety of genes involved in the response to external stress. We demonstrate that: <italic>(i)</italic> MDT-15 is required for the induction of p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-dependent immune effectors following exposure to a xenobiotic toxin, as well as during infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>(ii)</italic> MDT-15 controls the expression of some p38 MAP kinase PMK-1-independent immune effectors, but not all defense genes, (<italic>iii</italic>), MDT-15 functions downstream of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 cascade to control the induction of at least two immune effectors, <italic>(iv)</italic> the induction of xenobiotic detoxification genes and protection from the toxic effects of RPW-24 requires MDT-15, but not the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1, and (<italic>iv</italic>) MDT-15 is necessary for protection during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection and from phenazine toxins secreted by this organism.</p>
<p>The Mediator complex is strongly conserved from yeasts to humans, and is required for transcription by physically interacting with and directing the activity of RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Conaway1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Malik1">[31]</xref>. Although initial studies from yeast described the Mediator complex as a general regulator of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Holstege1">[32]</xref>, it is now becoming clear that the individual subunits of this complex, of which there are at least 26, play important roles in translating inputs from cell signaling pathways to specific outputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Conaway1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Malik1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Huang1">[33]</xref>. For example, the regulation of chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells requires MED12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Huang1">[33]</xref>, MED23 channels MAP kinase signaling activity to coordinate cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Boyer1">[34]</xref>, and MED15 serves as a regulatory node in lipid metabolism by directing the activity of the transcriptional activator SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Yang1">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, MED15's role as a lipid sensor is strongly conserved. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the MED15 homolog MDT-15 interacts with SBP-1, the SREBP homolog, and serves as an important regulator of lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Yang1">[20]</xref>. Likewise, the MED15 homolog in yeast (called GAL11p) serves a similar function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Thakur1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taubert et al. showed in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome-wide microarray analysis that MDT-15 coordinates the transcription of Phase I and Phase II detoxification genes, and is required to resist the lethal effects of a xenobiotic toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert2">[19]</xref> and agents that induce oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Goh1">[21]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, we found that MDT-15 is necessary to mount a detoxification response toward and provide protection from RPW-24, a xenobiotic toxin. Our studies extend the known functions of this conserved Mediator subunit to innate immunity in demonstrating that MDT-15 plays a critical role in controlling immune and detoxification pathway activation in a manner that is important for protection from bacterial infection and from the secreted phenazine toxins of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>We propose that the Mediator subunit MDT-15 links innate immune activation to xenobiotic detoxification responses as part of a general strategy to ensure survival in harsh environments. In their natural habits, nematodes encounter numerous threats from ingested pathogens and xenobiotic toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Lindblom1">[1]</xref>. Thus, coupling xenobiotic detoxification to innate immune activation may have been selected for by pathogens that secrete soluble toxins during infection. Whether the protection from phenazine toxins mediated by MDT-15 requires detoxification genes or occurs via another mechanism is not known, but it is interesting to note that MDT-15's function as a regulator of host protection may be evolutionarily conserved. In yeasts, the MDT-15 homolog Gal11p coordinates a protective cellular response following xenobiotic exposure, which is manifest as the upregulation of drug efflux pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Thakur2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>The data presented in this study imply the existence of surveillance mechanisms that monitor for xenobiotic toxins (or their effects) and signal through MDT-15/MED15 to simultaneously activate protective detoxification and innate immune responses. Whether such activation occurs in the context of xenobiotic-induced organelle dysfunction is not known. McEwan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-McEwan1">[15]</xref> and Dunbar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Dunbar1">[16]</xref> found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> monitor the integrity of its translational machinery as a means to detect pathogen invasion. Inhibition of translation by the secreted bacterial toxin ToxA leads to an antibacterial response via known immune pathways involving the transcription factor ZIP-2 and the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1. Several observations suggest, however, that MDT-15-mediated regulation of immune activation and detoxification gene induction by RPW-24 does not occur via a mechanism involving translation inhibition. First, we previously found that a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>zip-2</italic> gene did not affect the ability of RPW-24 to extend the survival of animals infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and genome-wide transcriptional analysis of animals exposed to RPW-24 did not suggest that this compound is an inhibitor of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-PukkilaWorley3">[9]</xref>. Second, the transcriptome analysis of animals exposed to ToxA did not show an abundance of Phase I and II detoxification genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-McEwan1">[15]</xref>. Finally, we show here that the ToxA-responsive, ZIP-2-regulated genes, <italic>irg-1</italic> and <italic>irg-2</italic>, are induced in <italic>mdt-15(RNAi)</italic> animals during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection to levels comparable to that observed in wild-type animals.</p>
<p>Melo et al. recently studied the behavioral response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to xenobiotic toxins known to disrupt the function of the mitochondria, the ribosome, and the endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Melo1">[3]</xref>. Inhibiting these essential processes by the action of small molecules or through targeted gene disruptions triggered an avoidance response, which required serotonergic and JNK signaling pathways. They proposed that organisms monitor disruption of core metabolic processes as a means to detect pathogen invasion and challenges from xenobiotic toxins. Based on the data reported here, however, it is not clear, whether immune signaling is an integral part of xenobiotic-elicited avoidance behavior, at least with respect to RPW-24. We found that the function of neither MDT-15 nor PMK-1 was required for the avoidance of RPW-24, indicating that the behavioral component of this protective response occurs upstream of MDT-15, or via separate mechanism altogether.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to determine the mechanism by which MDT-15 activates immune and detoxification responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In our genetic screen for regulators of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway, we identified a number of genes that are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, including <italic>mdt-15, fat-6, fat-7, elo-5, acs-19</italic> and <italic>C25A1.5</italic>. Indeed, MDT-15 is known to control the expression of <italic>fat-6</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Taubert1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Yang1">[20]</xref>. It is therefore possible that a fatty acid signaling molecule or membrane component is required for p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 activity. We found, however, in epistasis analyses with the MAP kinase phosphatase VHP-1 that MDT-15 functions downstream of PMK-1 to coordinate the expression of <italic>F08G5.6</italic> and <italic>F35E12.5</italic>. Thus, for at least a subset of immune genes, MDT-15 likely also physically interacts with sequence-specific regulators, such as ATF-7, a transcription factor that is the downstream signaling target of the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004143-Shivers1">[12]</xref>, to coordinate protective host responses mounted following exposure to xenobiotic toxins.</p>
