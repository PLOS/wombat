<abstract>
<p>Adipose tissues constitute an important component of metabolism, the dysfunction of which can cause obesity and type II diabetes. Here we show that differentiation of white and brown adipocytes requires Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1), a Rho GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) previously studied for its function in liver cancer. We identified <italic>Dlc1</italic> as a super-enhancer associated gene in both white and brown adipocytes through analyzing the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis. We further observed that <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression increases during differentiation, and knockdown of <italic>Dlc1</italic> by siRNA in white adipocytes reduces the formation of lipid droplets and the expression of fat marker genes. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>Dlc1</italic> in brown adipocytes reduces expression of brown fat-specific genes and diminishes mitochondrial respiration. <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a complete inability to differentiate into adipocytes, but this phenotype can be rescued by inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and filamentous actin (F-actin), suggesting the involvement of Rho pathway in DLC1-regulated adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, PPARγ binds to the promoter of <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene to regulate its expression during both white and brown adipocyte differentiation. These results identify DLC1 as an activator of white and brown adipocyte differentiation, and provide a molecular link between PPARγ and Rho pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity has become a major healthcare issue and causes metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref001">1</xref>]. Obesity is associated with an increase in the mass of white adipose tissues (WAT). While WAT primarily stores lipids, there is an additional type of adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue (BAT) that has anti-obesity effects by metabolizing lipids through UCP1-mediated uncoupled respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref003">3</xref>]. BAT and WAT may have opposing metabolic functions but their differentiation share a common intricate transcriptional program brought by a number of master regulators such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref004">4</xref>]. During differentiation of both types of adipocytes, there is an upregulation of general adipogenic markers such as <italic>Fabp4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref006">6</xref>] and <italic>Adiponectin</italic> (<italic>AdipoQ</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref008">8</xref>], and additionally in BAT only, there is also increased expression of brown fat genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref009">9</xref>], <italic>Cidea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref010">10</xref>], <italic>Elovl3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref011">11</xref>], and mitochondrial <italic>Cox</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref012">12</xref>]. Expression of these genes allows uncoupled respiration in BAT to utilize lipids for thermogenesis. This process can be further enhanced by cold exposure to activate the β3-adrenergic pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, or by norepinephrine or other agonists such as isoproterenol <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref013">13</xref>]. Long-term cold exposure has also been shown to induce differentiation of brite/beige adipocytes, a brown-like population of adipocytes within the subcutaneous WAT depots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref012">12</xref>]. These adipocytes also express <italic>Ucp1</italic> and undergo thermogenesis. Currently the list of regulators of white, brown and beige adipogenic differentiation is still far from complete. And bioinformatics approaches are increasingly utilized to identify novel regulators of adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref017">17</xref>]. Among these approaches, the super-enhancer (SE) association analysis has emerged as a useful tool in the search of novel adipogenic factors. SEs are large clusters of typical enhancers and they are stronger in terms of the ability to activate transcription than typical enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref018">18</xref>]. These SEs are usually enriched by cell-type-specific master transcription factor binding and therefore can be defined by the genome-wide binding profiles of these master transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref019">19</xref>]. SEs are also found to be associated with genes that define cell identity and this feature provides the mechanistic basis of the SE association analysis. Through this analysis, we identified RREB1 and PIM1 as new factors promoting brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>], while KLF11 was identified as an essential regulator of human white fat browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The Rho family of small guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPase) are components of signaling pathways that control actin cytoskeleton and related biological functions such as cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref021">21</xref>]. Rho GTPases are regulated in a cycle involving guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) that activate Rho by converting bound GDP to GTP and the opposing GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) that inactivate Rho by converting bound GTP to GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref022">22</xref>]. Active Rho activates Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and catalyzes the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin) stress fibers from monomeric G-actin. The formation of such a complex actin cytoskeleton allows the differentiation of motile cells such as smooth muscle cells through a transcriptional program brought by Myocardin Related Transcription Factor A (MRTF-A) and serum response factor (SRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref023">23</xref>]. Conversely, differentiation of non-motile cells such as adipocytes requires low levels of active Rho, ROCK and F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref027">27</xref>], and these could potentially be caused by activity of an upstream RhoGAP. However so far, only one RhoGAP out of about 80, <italic>p190-B</italic>, has been found to be involved in white adipogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref028">28</xref>], and none has been found to regulate brown adipogenic differentiation.</p>
<p>DLC1 is a GAP primarily for RhoA and has been mainly studied in cancer research as a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref029">29</xref>]. Aberrant RhoA signaling during inactivation of <italic>Dlc1</italic> has been shown to cause tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref030">30</xref>]. Interestingly, PPARγ has been found to increase <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression to inhibit tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref031">31</xref>], and because PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenic differentiation, we ask whether PPARγ can also regulate <italic>Dlc1</italic> level in adipocytes and affect differentiation. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that DLC1 has a role during development. <italic>Dlc1</italic>-null mice die at embryonic stage of E10.5, with growth defects in placenta, brain, heart and neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref033">33</xref>]. At this early developmental stage, adipose tissues have not been formed, and this raises the question: could DLC1 have a role in adipose tissues?</p>
<p>Here we show that DLC1 is a positive regulator of white and brown adipocyte differentiation. <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene is associated with PPARγ defined SEs in both white and brown adipocytes. Knockdown of <italic>Dlc1</italic> by siRNA significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression of fat markers in both adipocytes. In brown adipocytes, there was also reduced mitochondrial respiration as a result of compromised differentiation when <italic>Dlc1</italic> was knocked down. Additionally, a loss of function of <italic>Dlc1</italic> from <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts totally abolished adipogenic differentiation. A role of Rho-ROCK-(F-actin) pathway in this process was implied because inhibitors of ROCK and F-actin were able to restore the formation of lipid droplets in <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs. Finally, ChIP-seq and gene expression analyses showed that <italic>Dlc1</italic> is regulated by PPARγ in both white and brown adipocytes. Together, our results provide evidence for DLC1 as a regulator of white and brown adipocyte differentiation, bridging the effects of PPARγ transcriptional regulation and Rho signaling.</p>

<title><italic>Dlc1</italic> Associates with Super-enhancers in both White and Brown Adipocytes</title>
<p>Recently we profiled PPARγ binding in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>] differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> from a mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2, which was committed to the brown lineage by BMP7 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref034">34</xref>]. Using the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARγ in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>], as well as in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref016">16</xref>], we defined the SEs in both lineages and identified hundreds of genes associated with these SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>]. Among these genes we found most of the established adipogenic markers such as <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> in both lineages, while we also found the known brown markers including <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Ppara</italic> and <italic>Cidea</italic> specifically in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>]. To identify novel adipogenic regulators through this SE association analysis, we selected the Top-100 SE associated genes from both lineages and overlapped these two gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We found there was an overlap of 14 common genes between these two lists and 86 BA- / WA-specific genes were also identified through this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As expected, we found most of the brown markers as well as <italic>Rreb1</italic> and <italic>Pim1</italic> in the BA-specific SE associated genes. In the common genes, we found <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Lpl</italic> and <italic>Angptl4</italic> which were known to have a role in regulating adipogenesis. Interestingly, we also found <italic>Dlc1</italic>, a gene which was not studied in the context of fat cell differentiation, to be associated with SEs in both lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Moreover, even higher levels of PPARγ binding were observed in both brown adipose tissue and epididymal white adipose tissue, suggesting that <italic>Dlc1</italic> is also regulated by PPARγ defined SEs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We further examined <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression in various tissues using RNA-seq data from ENCODE and we found that <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression is present in epididymal WAT (eWAT, a visceral fat depot) and subcutaneous WAT and also particularly high in BAT relative to liver, thymus or testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref035">35</xref>]. Together, these data strongly suggest that DLC1 has a role in regulating both white and brown adipogenesis.</p>

<title>DLC1 is required for white adipogenesis</title>
<p>To examine <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression during white adipogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a classic WA cell line 3T3-L1. We found that <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression increased by 6-fold during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that the gene may be required for white adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To test if <italic>Dlc1</italic> is indeed required for white adipogenesis, we knocked down the expression of <italic>Dlc1</italic> using siRNA (i.e. <italic>si-Dlc1</italic>) in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and examined the impact on adipogenesis efficiency by both Oil-Red-O staining and qRT-PCR of adipogenic markers. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown led to a significant reduction of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, classic adipogenic marker genes such as <italic>Adiponectin</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> were also reduced by <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To test the function of <italic>Dlc1</italic> in primary white adipocytes, we isolated the Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells from inguinal white fat and knocked down <italic>Dlc1</italic> before adipogenic induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). As determined by Oil-Red-O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), there was a large decrease in lipid accumulation hence adipogenesis efficiency in iWAT SVF cells by <italic>si-Dlc1</italic>. And this was accompanied by reduced expression of adipogenic genes <italic>Adiponectin</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> in <italic>si-Dlc1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Furthermore, the reduced efficiency of differentiation was correlated with a decrease in the amount of perilipin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref036">36</xref>], a mature adipocyte marker that associates with the surface of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that <italic>Dlc1</italic> is necessary for the differentiation of white adipocytes.</p>

<title>DLC1 is required for brown adipogenesis</title>
<p>We next asked whether DLC1 is also required for brown adipogenesis. To check <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression during brown adipogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used two BA differentiation models: C3H10T1/2 cells pretreated with BMP7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref034">34</xref>] and BAT-WT1 cells (an immortalized BA preadipocyte cell line derived from mouse BAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref037">37</xref>]. We found that <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression increased significantly during differentiation of both cell lines, suggesting that <italic>Dlc1</italic> is important for brown adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To test the function of <italic>Dlc1</italic> in brown adipogenesis, we knocked down this gene in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3B and 3F</xref>) and observed that <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown reduced differentiation of both BAT-WT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). For BAT-WT1 cells, there were not only reductions in expression of general adipogenic genes such as <italic>Fabp4</italic> and <italic>Adiponectin</italic> but also BAT-specific genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Elovl3</italic>, and mitochondrial genes such as <italic>Cox7a1</italic> and <italic>Cox5b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We also asked whether the reduced differentiation and BAT/mitochondrial gene expression could affect mitochondrial respiration. In this regards we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of the cells and observed that basal, uncoupled and maximal respiration—the latter two stimulated by oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide-<italic>p-</italic>trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; mitochondrial uncoupler), respectively—were reduced by <italic>si-Dlc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). As brown cells are known to be involved in thermogenesis, we added isoproterenol, an activator of the β3-adrenergic pathway, to stimulate BA thermogenesis. We found that <italic>Ucp1</italic>, a classic marker of thermogenesis, was significantly reduced in <italic>si-Dlc1</italic> cells compared with <italic>si-control</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>si-Dlc1</italic> also reduced thermogenesis. The lower mitochondrial respiration and thermogenesis were likely secondary to the reduced differentiation of brown adipocytes. For C3H10T1/2 cells, we also observed reductions in expression of general adipogenic genes as well as BAT-specific genes upon <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).

<title><italic>Dlc1</italic> heterozygous mice show no phenotype in adipose tissues and whole-body metabolism</title>
<p>To test the adipogenic function of DLC1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we acquired the <italic>Dlc1</italic> heterozygous (<italic>Dlc1/+</italic>) mice from the Popescu lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref032">32</xref>]. As the homozygous <italic>Dlc1</italic> mutant is embryonically lethal, we examined the <italic>Dlc1/+</italic> mice for possible metabolic phenotypes. Our results suggest that <italic>Dlc1/+</italic> mice showed no difference in total body mass, lean mass or fat mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), or the masses of BAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT) or eWAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Microscopically there was no obvious difference in the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining of BAT or iWAT between wild-type and <italic>Dlc1/+</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) nor was there significant molecular difference in terms of UCP1 level in BAT or iWAT between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). To test whether there are differences in energy expenditure at the animal physiology level, mice were placed individually in metabolic chambers where food intake, ambulatory movement, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production were measured, and the latter two were used to calculate respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry. We noticed that there was no significant difference in these parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To study whether DLC1 could affect the adipogenic differentiation of brite/beige adipocytes, we subjected mice to a temperature of 4°C for a week to induce the inguinal fat depot to generate beige adipocytes that express UCP1. In wild-type mice, the low temperature reduced the lipid content in BAT and also produced beige adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets in the iWAT compared with wild-type mice kept at room temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). However even at low temperature (4°C), both adipose tissues from <italic>Dlc1/+</italic> mice were indistinguishable from wild-type using H&amp;E staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2D Fig</xref>) and UCP1 protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174761.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Particularly, this data from iWAT suggested that <italic>Dlc1/+</italic> mice have no defect in beige adipogenic differentiation.

<title>Adipogenic role of Dlc1 involves the rho pathway</title>
<p>A possible explanation for the lack of metabolic phenotype in <italic>Dlc1</italic> heterozygous mice is that the presence of one copy of the <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene might already be sufficient for normal adipose tissue development and function. To study the impact of DLC1 ablation on adipogenic differentiation in cells with both copies of the <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene removed, we turned to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF). <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (or <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic>) embryo dies at E10.5 stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref032">32</xref>], so we isolated embryos at E9.5. Using a SV40 large T antigen protocol, we immortalized the MEF cells and differentiated these cells into brown-like adipocytes. First we confirmed the absence of DLC1 protein in <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We also noticed that while wild-type MEFs differentiated into lipid-laden adipocytes, the <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs failed to produce any mature adipocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>To investigate the mechanism by which <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> led to defects in adipogenic differentiation, we considered that DLC1 protein has three domains: an N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, a RhoGAP domain, and a C-terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)- related lipid-transfer (START) domain. The SAM domain allows protein-protein interaction, while the START domain has a role in lipid transport or lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref029">29</xref>]. In this manuscript, we focused on studying the RhoGAP function of DLC1. As DLC1 causes the conversion of active Rho-GTP to inactive Rho-GDP, we expect that <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs have deficiency in this conversion and thus have higher levels of active Rho. We measured the amount of active RhoA and found that indeed there was higher level of active RhoA in the <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This result agrees with a previous literature which showed that active Rho is associated with an undifferentiated cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref025">25</xref>]. As a high level of active RhoA is also associated with an increased formation of F-actin stress fibers especially those found in the center of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref038">38</xref>], we also checked and found a higher number of central stress fibers in <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). To ask whether the adipogenic regulation by DLC1 acts through the Rho pathway, we subjected differentiating <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs to treatment with either Y-27632 (an inhibitor of Rho<italic>-</italic>associated kinase/ROCK), or Latrunculin-B (an inhibitor of F-actin assembly). ROCK and F-actin formation are effectors of the Rho pathway and normally inhibits adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref039">39</xref>]. We reasoned that ROCK and F-actin are downstream of DLC1 in the Rho pathway, and their inhibition will rescue the effects of <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> and increase adipogenic differentiation. Indeed, we found that both Y-27632 and Latrunculin-B treatments provided partial rescue, as seen in an increase in both lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4G</xref>) and adipogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). These results corroborate the findings obtained using <italic>Dlc1</italic> siRNA and suggest that DLC1 is an important regulator of adipogenic differentiation through the Rho pathway.</p>

Our analysis of published ChIP-seq datasets revealed that PPARγ bound to the promoter of <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene in mouse BAT, eWAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref017">17</xref>], 3T3-L1 white adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref040">40</xref>] and C3H10T1/2 derived brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref014">14</xref>] at multiple positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Three major PPARγ binding peaks (P1-P3) were identified at position—0.25 kb, - 4.25 kb and—13 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene. Moreover, our PPARγ binding ChIP in C3H10T1/2 cells (Brown adipocytes) confirmed that PPARγ indeed binds to P1-P3 at the promoter / upstream region of <italic>Dlc1</italic> gene but not a region—120 kb upstream of the <italic>Dlc1</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174761.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). <italic>Fabp4</italic> gene promoter which contains a PPAR response element (PPRE) was used as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref041">41</xref>] for PPARγ ChIP, while a chromosome 15 (Chr.15) region devoid of any known genes was included as a negative control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref042">42</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that DLC1 is essential for the differentiation of both white and brown adipocytes. The phenotype was observed using <italic>Dlc1</italic> siRNA in two types of white adipocytes and two types of brown adipocytes, and was even more noticeable in <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs with a complete absence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplets were nonetheless restored by the treatment of inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase/ROCK and F-actin, implicating the Rho pathway in DLC1 regulation. We also showed that adipogenic regulator PPARγ was recruited to the gene promoter of <italic>Dlc1</italic> to regulate its expression in both white and brown adipocytes. Together, the results support the importance of DLC1 in white and brown adipogenic differentiation.</p>
<p>Recently, the Rho/ROCK pathway has been a subject of intense study, as inhibition of the components of Rho/ROCK pathway was shown to increase adipogenic differentiation of WAT, BAT and beige fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref039">39</xref>]. Moreover, downstream of Rho and ROCK is a transcriptional program led by SRF and MRTF-A that target about a thousand genes involved in cytoskeleton, cell growth and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref043">43</xref>], regulating cell lineage between adipocyte and smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref045">45</xref>]. As DLC1 is a RhoGAP, the involvement of the Rho pathway in the regulation of DLC1 in adipogenic differentiation is in line with the function of DLC1 as a RhoGAP, but we have nevertheless shown that DLC1 is involved in both white and brown fat differentiation and is likely to be part of the core machinery controlling the regulation of Rho. Further work can be pursued to test whether and how DLC1 affects downstream MRTF-A/SRF and the switch of cell lineages.</p>
<p>There are about 80 RhoGAPs in the genome and it is a curious question how many of these proteins could play a role in adipogenic differentiation. While RhoGAP p190-B is known to regulate adipogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref028">28</xref>], DLC2 (or STARD13), a closely related protein to DLC1, was found to be not involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus it is likely that there is some form of selection of specific RhoGAP proteins for adipogenic differentiation. Even if these proteins are supposed to act on RhoA or other Rho-related GTPases, there could be contextual differences in their functions such as temporal, subcellular localization, tissue-specific cofactors or post-translational protein modifications that restrict their access to Rho or modify their activity. A systematic characterization of each RhoGAP in adipogenic differentiation could help to resolve some of these questions.</p>
<p>The rescue of lipid droplets in <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs by the treatment of ROCK inhibitor and F-actin inhibitor suggests that the Rho pathway is involved in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation by DLC1, but it might not be the only mechanism. First, this rescue is only partial as seen from the expression analyses. Second, the upregulation of active RhoA in <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> is small and might not be able to account for the total abolishment of adipogenic differentiation of <italic>Dlc1-KO</italic> MEFs. To resolve this paradox, we note that DLC1 does have non-Rho related functions, including the binding to structural proteins such as caveolin lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref047">47</xref>], adapter/scaffolding protein 14-3-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref049">49</xref>], or elongation factor EF1A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref050">50</xref>], These non-Rho functions of DLC1 might also affect adipogenic differentiation and could be explored in greater details.</p>
<p>PPARγ is a master regulator of general adipogenic differentiation as seen for its roles in white, brown, and beige adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref053">53</xref>]. While different adipocytes vary in post-translational modifications of PPARγ or tissue-specific recruitment of cofactors such as PRDM16, the common function of PPARγ in all types of adipocytes is to activate the expression of many genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis, adipokine production and insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref054">54</xref>]. Our results suggest that <italic>Dlc1</italic> is also a PPARγ -target gene and is directly involved in the process of adipogenic differentiation. Further work can be pursued to test whether DLC1 also affects lipid metabolism, adipokine production or insulin signaling. In particular, DLC1 has a START domain that was found to be important in lipid transport or lipid metabolism in other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref055">55</xref>]. Potentially the START domain could bind lipids and regulate subcellular localization of the protein. Other START proteins bind a large range of lipid ligands such as cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingolipids, oxysterols and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0174761.ref055">55</xref>], and it is interesting to find which ligand binds to DLC1.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings have provided additional insights into the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. The discovery of DLC1 as both a white and a brown adipogenic regulator shows its importance in the fundamental development of the two tissues. This is a helpful step towards improving our treatment options to ameliorate obesity and bring metabolic balance.</p>
