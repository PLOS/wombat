        <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs) are a family of dual-specificity phosphatases. Endothelial cells express multiple MKP family members, such as MKP-3. However, the effects of MKP-3 on endothelial biological processes have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we address the association between MKP-3 and endothelial Nitric oxide (NO) formation under ischemia/reperfusion (IS/RP) condition. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to IS/RP treatment. The MKP-3 expression and NO formation were examined. IS/RP induced endothelial MKP-3 expression and inhibited eNOS expression and NO formation, accompanied by an increase of endothelial apoptosis. The siRNA experiments showed that MKP-3 was an important mediator in impairing eNOS expression and NO production in endothelial cells. Transfection of HUVECs with constitutively active ERK plasmids suggested that the above mentioned effect of MKP-3 was via inactivation of ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, impairment of eNOS expression was restored by treatment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and related to histone deacetylation and recruitment of HDAC1 to the eNOS promoter. Finally, Salvianolic acid A (SalA) markedly attenuated induction of MKP-3 and inhibition of eNOS expression and NO formation under endothelial IS/RP condition. Overall, these results for the first time demonstrated that IS/RP inhibited eNOS expression by inactivation of ERK1/2 and recruitment of HDAC1 to the gene promoter, leading to decreased NO formation through a MKP-3-dependent mechanism in endothelial cells, and SalA has therapeutic significance in protecting endothelial cells from impaired NO formation in response to IS/RP.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a diatomic free-radical gas which is crucial for a variety of biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Moncada1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Moncada2">[2]</xref>. NO is synthesized by a family of enzymes called NO synthases (NOS). There are three NOS isoforms in mammals: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Small1">[3]</xref>. Under physiological conditions, the dominant NOS isoform in the vasculature is eNOS, which catalyzes the formation of basal level NO to conduct physiological actions including effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibition of adhesion of neutrophils and platelets to the endothelium, and maintenance of an anti-apoptotic environment in the vessel wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Sessa1">[4]</xref>. Rather than being a constitutive enzyme as was first suggested, eNOS is dynamically regulated at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rafikov1">[5]</xref>. Many physiopathological events, such as ischemia/reperfusion (IS/RP) injury, alter eNOS expression level or its activity, resulting in a change of NO formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rafikov1">[5]</xref>. Previous studies suggested that pleotropic signaling pathways were involved in regulation of eNOS activity, such as PI3K/AKT, MAPKs, and Rho-kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rafikov1">[5]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which IS/RP influence the eNOS activity are not clearly elucidated in endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs) are a family of dual-specificity phosphatases and play important roles in the regulation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK signaling pathways which are induced by growth factors, cellular stress, and inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Medhora1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Kiemer1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Yang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig1">[9]</xref>. Endothelial cells express several MKPs, such as MKP-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig1">[9]</xref>. As a cytosolic phosphatase, MKP-3 prefers to target ERK1/2. To date, several studies demonstrated important roles of MKP-3 in endothelial apoptosis and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Whetzel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig2">[11]</xref>. However, no further investigations are provided concerning the effects of MKP-3 on other endothelial physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p>
      <p><italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, commonly named “Danshen” in China, is a valuable medicinal plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Wang1">[12]</xref>, and can be used to promote blood flow and to resolve blood stasis. It is also an important part in compound danshen dripping pills which have been passed phase II human clinical trial of Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Salvianolic acid A, also known as SalA, is one of the main active, water-soluble components in <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>. Previous studies have indicated the beneficial effects of SalA on preventing oxidative stress, platelet aggregation, ischemia, and hepatocirrhosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Ho1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our preliminary microarray data, we found that IS/RP upregulated MKP-3 expression, which was inhibited significantly by SalA pretreatment. Further, eNOS expression level showed opposite results after the same treatment method. Thus, in the present study, we firstly address the correlation between MKP-3 and eNOS expression under IS/RP condition in endothelial cells. Moreover, we detected whether SalA exhibits beneficial effects in these processes.</p>

        <title>The Expression Level of MKP Family Members and eNOS in Microarray Data</title>
        <p>In our preliminary study, HUVECs were subjected to IS/RP injury with or without SalA pretreatment, and then the expression profile was obtained through microarray technique. The data demonstrated that IS/RP resulted in enhanced expression of MKP family members, such as MKP-3, MKP-5, and MKP-7, and interestingly, SalA merely inhibited IS/RP-upregulated MKP-3 expression. Furthermore, eNOS expression was also changed after IS/RP with or without SalA pretreatment, and presented an opposite results in contrast to MKP-3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0042076-t001"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref>). These data indicated that maybe a negative correlation existed between MKP-3 and eNOS under IS/RP condition.</p>

        <title>IS/RP Induces Endothelial MKP-3 Expression</title>
        <p>Firstly, we investigated whether IS/RP induced endothelial MKP-3 expression. Cells were treated with ischemia for 5 hours and reperfusion for indicated time points, and then MKP-3 expression level was detected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, IS/RP led to a significant increase in MKP-3 mRNA level, which reached a peak about four-fold increase at 1 hour reperfusion and declined to near basal level at 3 hours. Additionally, the expression pattern of MKP-3 protein was similar to that of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine the precise mechanism by which MKP-3 inhibits eNOS expression and NO production, the action of MKP-3 on its potential downstream kinases p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 was examined. Firstly, we detected whether IS/RP altered endothelial p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 pathways. IS/RP caused a marked dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). Moreover, reperfusion for 30 minutes resulted in activation of p38 and JNK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>), which was in accordance with previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Yang2">[16]</xref>.

We transfected HUVECs with constitutively active ERK1/2 expression plasmids (caERK), and noticed a transfection efficiency up to 70% as determined using green fluorescent protein.

        <title>The Impaired eNOS Expression is Mediated by HDAC1 Binding to the Gene Promoter</title>
        <p>Histone acetylation modification participates in transcriptional regulation of genes by affecting the status of chromatin remodeling. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones and contribute to transcriptional repression. Here, we studied whether the down-regulation of eNOS expression by MKP-3 was concerned in histone deacetylation and recruitment of HDACs to the eNOS promoter. Firstly, we noticed that global HDAC activity was increased in endothelial cells by IS/RP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>). HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin (TSA) significantly inhibited IS/RP-impaired eNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6b, c</xref>), and attenuation of impaired NO formation was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6d</xref>). These results suggested that HDACs maybe played roles in IS/RP-mediated down-regulation of eNOS expression. Thus, we further detected whether the binding of HDACs to eNOS promoter was changed. ChIP assays showed that IS/RP increased the recruitment of HDAC1 to the promoter of eNOS, and this process was hampered significantly by transfection of MKP-3 siRNA or caERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). However, we detected slight alteration concerning the binding of HDAC2 to eNOS promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Additionally, acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3) was regulated in an opposing manner compared with HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Overall, these studies implicated that the down-regulation of eNOS expression via MKP-3/ERK1/2 signaling was associated with histone deacetylation and recruitment of HDAC1 to the eNOS promoter.</p>

      <p>NO is a critical effective molecule in the cardiovascular system.

However, it should be taken into mind that decreased NO formation was not always due to inhibited eNOS expression. Other than at transcriptional level, eNOS activity can also be regulated at posttranscriptional levels via phosphorylation, S-nitrosylation, and interaction of eNOS with other proteins, such as caveolins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Bauer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Erwin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Fleming1">[24]</xref>.

MKP-3 is unique within the MKP family, because it is exclusively located in the cytosol, indicating a specific regulatory role in inactivating Mitogen-activated protein kinases by targeting cytoplasmic substrates or by blocking nuclear localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Muda1">[28]</xref>. At present, several studies demonstrated important roles of MKP-3 in endothelial apoptosis and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Whetzel1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Rossig2">[11]</xref>. However, no further evidence is presented addressing the actions of MKP-3 on other endothelial physiological and pathophysiological events. Our current study showed that MKP-3 was induced under IS/RP condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Some study showed that MKP-3 expression has been linked to Ras activity in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Furukawa1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Furukawa2">[30]</xref>. However, little is known presently about the mechanism involved in endothelial MKP-3 induction. Maybe the oxidative stress, increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or other IS/RP-related events responsible for this process.</p>
      <p>It was noteworthy in our study that, after MKP-3 expression was suppressed effectively by siRNA technique, IS/RP-impaired eNOS expression, eNOS activity, and NO formation were largely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g003">Fig. 3a–d</xref>). Thus, these results indicated that there was a causal relationship between IS/RP-mediated induction of MKP-3 and inhibition of eNOS expression and NO formation, which, more or less, provided us a better understanding of the biological actions of MKP-3 in endothelial cells. Of the MKP family members, it is MKP-3 that specifically inactivates ERK1/2. In our study, we observed significant up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after transfection of HUVECs with MKP-3 siRNA, while phosphorylated p38 and JNK1/2 levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Furthermore, after transfection of HUVECs with caERK plasmids, no obvious reduction of eNOS expression and NO formation was detected under IS/RP condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g005">Fig. 5a–d</xref>), indicating that inactivation of ERK1/2 contributed to decrease in endothelial NO production. Taken these results together, we speculated that IS/RP-induced MKP-3 dephosphorylated ERK1/2, leading to impaired basal levels of eNOS expression, and NO formation in endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>The acetylation of core histones correlates with transcriptional activity in many genes, allowing DNA to unfold and providing access for transcription factors to bind to their targeted promoters. The turnover of acetylated histones is regulated by the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), where HATs generally allow transcription and HDACs repress transcription. HDACs were shown to be involved originally in cancer and neurological disease, and recent reports implicated their crucial roles in cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Zhou1">[31]</xref>. The broad inhibitor of HDACs, TSA, has been shown to influence eNOS expression in HUVECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Searles1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Gan1">[32]</xref>. In line with this, we noticed that IS/RP enhanced global HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>) and inhibition of HDACs by TSA alleviated IS/RP-impaired eNOS expression dose-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6b, c</xref>), suggesting crucial roles of HDACs in down-regulation of eNOS expression. Current studies reported that HDAC1 and 2 were related to cardiovascular system, which were widely expressed and resided nearly exclusively in the cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Searles1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Zhou1">[31]</xref>. HDAC1 was shown to be involved in regulaton of eNOS promoter activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Gan1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Gan2">[33]</xref>. In our result, IS/RP increased the binding of HDAC1 to the promoter of eNOS, which was hampered significantly by transfection of MKP-3 siRNA or caERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Accordingly, Ac-H3 was regulated in an opposing manner as compared with HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). However, it seemed that the alteration was not much obviously concerning the binding of HDAC2 to eNOS promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g006">Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Thus, our findings indicated that histone deacetylation and recruitment of HDAC1 to the eNOS promoter might be implicated in the down-regulation of eNOS gene expression via MKP-3/ERK1/2 signaling.</p>
      <p>SalA is one of the main active, water-soluble components in <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, which is commonly named “Danshen” in China, and has been widely used as a medicinal plant for more than two thousand years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Wang1">[12]</xref>. <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> is an important part in compound danshen dripping pills which have a therapeutic potential on cardiac arrest treatment and have been passed phase II human clinical trial of FDA. In the past few years, many beneficial effects of SalA on cardiovascular system have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Ho1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, mechanisms of how SalA regulate biological processes in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes have been investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Yang3">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Zhang1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Oh1">[36]</xref>. During IS/RP injury, SalA has been reported to be a cardiovascular protective agent, mainly through its anti-apoptosis activity via induction of Bcl-2 and inhibition of Bax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Pan1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Fan1">[38]</xref>. Further, anti-inflammatory property was suggested as well which was correlated with the inhibition of granulocyte adherence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0042076-Jiang1">[39]</xref>. In the presented study, SalA was firstly provided as a potential protectant against IS/RP-impaired endothelial NO formation. We found that SalA blocked IS/RP-incuced MKP-3 expression dose-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g007">Fig. 7a, b</xref>), and interestingly, decreased phosphor-ERK1/2, eNOS expression, eNOS activity, and NO formation as well as endothelial apoptosis in response to IS/RP were also markedly attenuated by SalA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g007">Fig. 7a–e</xref>). Thus, SalA demonstrated effective protection against IS/RP-impaired NO production maybe through its inhibition of MKP-3 leading to restoration of hampered ERK1/2 activation and eNOS expression, which has therapeutic significance in the states of IS/RP-induced vasculature injuries.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that IS/RP-induced MKP-3 impaired eNOS expression and NO formation via inactivation of ERK1/2 pathway and recruitment of HDAC1 to the eNOS promoter, which provided us not only a better understanding of the biological actions of MKP-3 in endothelial cells, but also a novel mechanism to explain impaired basal endothelial NO production in response to IS/RP. Moreover, we presented SalA as a potential drug component to effectively alleviate IS/RP-mediated induction of MKP-3 and inhibition of NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042076-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, these findings may have significance for the therapeutic application in IS/RP-related diseases.</p>
