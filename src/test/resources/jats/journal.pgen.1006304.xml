<abstract>
<p>During meiotic prophase, telomeres cluster, forming the bouquet chromosome arrangement, and facilitate homologous chromosome pairing. In fission yeast, bouquet formation requires switching of telomere and centromere positions. Centromeres are located at the spindle pole body (SPB) during mitotic interphase, and upon entering meiosis, telomeres cluster at the SPB, followed by centromere detachment from the SPB. Telomere clustering depends on the formation of the microtubule-organizing center at telomeres by the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex (LINC), while centromere detachment depends on disassembly of kinetochores, which induces meiotic centromere formation. However, how the switching of telomere and centromere positions occurs during bouquet formation is not fully understood. Here, we show that, when impaired telomere interaction with the LINC or microtubule disruption inhibited telomere clustering, kinetochore disassembly-dependent centromere detachment and accompanying meiotic centromere formation were also inhibited. Efficient centromere detachment required telomere clustering-dependent SPB recruitment of a conserved telomere component, Taz1, and microtubules. Furthermore, when artificial SPB recruitment of Taz1 induced centromere detachment in telomere clustering-defective cells, spindle formation was impaired. Thus, detachment of centromeres from the SPB without telomere clustering causes spindle impairment. These findings establish novel regulatory mechanisms, which prevent concurrent detachment of telomeres and centromeres from the SPB during bouquet formation and secure proper meiotic divisions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Meiosis is a type of cell division, that generates haploid gametes and is essential for sexual reproduction. During meiosis, telomeres cluster on a small region of the nuclear periphery, forming a conserved chromosome arrangement referred to as the “bouquet”. Because the bouquet arrangement facilitates homologous chromosome pairing, which is essential for proper meiotic chromosome segregation, it is of great importance to understand how the bouquet arrangement is formed. In fission yeast, the bouquet arrangement requires switching of telomere and centromere positions. During mitosis, centromeres are located at the fungal centrosome called the spindle pole body (SPB). Upon entering meiosis, telomeres cluster at the SPB, and centromeres become detached from the SPB, forming the bouquet arrangement. In this study, we show that centromere detachment is linked with telomere clustering. When telomere clustering was inhibited, centromere detachment was also inhibited. This regulatory relationship depended on a conserved telomere component, Taz1, and microtubules. Furthermore, we show that the regulatory relationship is crucial for proper meiotic divisions when telomere clustering is defective. Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown regulatory relationship between meiotic telomere and centromere positions in bouquet formation, which secures proper meiotic divisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromosome positioning changes dynamically during development and differentiation, and contributes to various chromosomal events including gene expression and DNA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref005">5</xref>]. Especially during meiosis, chromosomes adopt a characteristic position called the “bouquet” arrangement, in which telomeres cluster at the nuclear periphery. The bouquet arrangement is highly conserved among eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref007">7</xref>], and how it is formed and what functions it has are important questions in the field of meiosis.</p>
<p>Studies of various organisms show that the bouquet arrangement facilitates homologous chromosome pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref009">9</xref>]. Bouquet-defective mutants of yeasts and mammals exhibit impaired homologous chromosome pairing and phenotypes associated with the impaired pairing, such as increased non-homologous association, decreased recombination, and defective formation of the synaptonemal complex, a structure that bridges the paired homologous chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref023">23</xref>]. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, special chromosome regions called “pairing centers” cluster instead of telomeres, and impaired clustering of pairing centers causes similar defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref029">29</xref>]. Homologous chromosome pairing is essential for formation of chiasmata, which physically link homologous chromosomes and enable their segregation at meiosis I (reductional segregation). Consistently, bouquet-defective organisms also exhibit impaired chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Among different organisms, the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> shows the most prominent example of the bouquet arrangement. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> mitotic chromosomes are positioned with their centromeres clustered at the spindle pole body (SPB; a centrosome equivalent in fungi) and their telomeres located away from it (this corresponds to the “Rabl” configuration seen in other organisms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref031">31</xref>]. Under nitrogen-starved conditions, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> cells enter meiosis through cell conjugation. Around this period, telomeres cluster at the SPB and centromeres become detached from it, forming the bouquet arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref032">32</xref>]. When the bouquet arrangement is formed, the SPB oscillates between the cell ends with the clustered telomeres, generating so-called “horsetail” nuclear movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, Horsetail stage). The SPB-led telomere movements promote pairing of homologous chromosomes by inducing their alignment and contact; impairment of either telomere clustering or horsetail movements compromises homologous chromosome pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Changes in chromosome positioning during meiosis and LINC-dependent telocentrosome formation.</title>
<p>(A) Changes in chromosome positioning during meiosis. During mitotic interphase, centromeres (red circles) are located at the SPB, while telomeres (blue circles) are located away from it. When cells enter meiosis by cell conjugation, telomeres cluster at the SPB, which radiates microtubules, and centromeres become detached from it (Karyogamy). After nuclear fusion, the diploid nucleus becomes elongated and oscillates between the cell ends, led by the SPB (Horsetail stage). Thereafter, the nucleus remains in the middle of the cell with several microtubules extending in parallel to the long cell axis until meiotic divisions start (Post-horsetail stage). (B) Factors required for telomere-LINC interaction and telocentrosome formation. γ-TuC: γ-tubulin complex; NE: nuclear envelope.</p>

<p>Studies of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> have unveiled additional functions of the bouquet arrangement. Telomere clustering additionally contributes to spindle formation, and defective telomere clustering causes impairment of spindle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref035">35</xref>]. Furthermore, centromere detachment from the SPB induces the formation of meiosis-specific centromeres. During homologous chromosome segregation, homologous chromosomes attach to opposite SPBs (bipolar attachment) with sister chromatids attaching to the same SPB (monopolar attachment) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref037">37</xref>]. At this period, the kinetochores on the sister centromeres face the same side (kinetochore mono-orientation), facilitating monopolar attachment of sister chromatids, while centromere cohesion persists, preventing sister chromatid separation upon their bipolar attachment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref038">38</xref>]. Persistent centromere cohesion also enables sister chromatid segregation (equational segregation) at meiosis II. Without centromere detachment from the SPB, meiotic centromere properties are not properly established and sister chromatids frequently undergo equational segregation at meiosis I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref040">40</xref>]. Centromere detachment also induces meiotic centromere formation in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>The linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex formed by the conserved SUN (Sad1/Unc-84) and KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne homology) domain nuclear membrane proteins recently emerged as a key player in SPB association of telomeres and centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref044">44</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, the LINC complex consisting of Sad1 (SUN) and Kms1/Kms2 (KASH) is localized at the SPB. Upon entering meiosis, meiosis-specific Bqt1 and Bqt2 recruit the LINC complex to telomeres, resulting in localization of Sad1 and Kms1/Kms2 at telomeres in addition to the SPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>]. The telomere-recruited LINC complexes form the microtubule-organizing center termed the “telocentrosome” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Subsequently, microtubule motors gather telomeres at the SPB by moving on SPB- and telocentrosome-nucleated microtubules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s001">S1C Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>]. SPB localization of centromeres also depends on the LINC complex; the Csi1-dependent interaction of the outer kinetochore components with Sad1 causes tethering of mitotic centromeres to the SPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref044">44</xref>]. When the bouquet is formed, the outer kinetochore components delocalize from the centromere, and this kinetochore disassembly causes centromere detachment from the SPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic>, centromere detachment immediately follows telomere clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref048">48</xref>], and both events require mating pheromone-dependent activation of MAP kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref049">49</xref>]. Together with the fact that SPB localization of telomeres and centromeres depends on the LINC complex, these facts suggest that regulation of centromere detachment and telomere clustering is related. However, their regulatory relationship remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we show that, when telomere clustering is inhibited, centromere detachment is also inhibited. Efficient centromere detachment requires SPB recruitment of the telomere component Taz1 by telomere clustering and microtubules that drive telomere clustering. We provide evidence indicating that this regulation secures proper spindle formation when telomere clustering is defective. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a regulatory relationship between telomere and centromere positions, which is critical for proper execution of meiotic divisions.</p>

<p>We first examined telomere positioning by visualizing the telomere-proximal <italic>sod2</italic> locus on chromosome I using the lacI/lacO recognition system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref050">50</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Mitotic interphase). In wild-type cells, during mitotic interphase, <italic>sod2</italic> signals were located away from the SPB, which was visualized by an mCherry-tagged, conserved SPB component, Sfi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref051">51</xref>]. By contrast, they were mostly juxtaposed with the SPB during karyogamy and the meiotic mononuclear stage (including the horsetail and post-horsetail stages; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), confirming the occurrence of telomere clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, WT). Telomere clustering depends on telomere-LINC interaction, and a Sad1 interactor, Bqt1, and a telomere-Bqt1 connector, Rap1, are essential for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref052">52</xref>]. Consistently, loss of either Bqt1 (<italic>bqt1Δ</italic>) or Rap1 (<italic>rap1Δ</italic>) caused almost complete elimination of <italic>sod2</italic>-SPB juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Furthermore, Rap1 interacts with telomeres via two different telomere-binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref054">54</xref>]. Loss of either Taz1 (<italic>taz1Δ</italic>) or a Rap1-Pot1 connector, Poz1 (<italic>poz1Δ</italic>), probably partially compromises telomere-LINC interaction, and loss of both eliminates the interaction completely. Accordingly, introduction of <italic>taz1Δ</italic> or <italic>poz1Δ</italic> mutation only reduced or rarely affected <italic>sod2</italic>-SPB juxtaposition, whereas introduction of both mutations almost completely eliminated their juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, Karyogamy). Thus, telomere-clustering defects are correlated with telomere-LINC interaction defects. Telomere clustering also depends on telocentrosome formation, which requires a γ-tubulin complex(γ-TuC)-recruiting factor, Mto1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>], and <italic>sod2</italic>-SPB juxtaposition was reduced in <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined centromere positioning by visualizing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant Cnp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref055">55</xref>]. In wild-type cells, all centromeres were co-localized with the SPB during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, Mitotic interphase), but they were mostly located away from it during karyogamy and the horsetail stage (judged by a single nucleus with an astral microtubule array; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, WT).

Therefore, centromere detachment from the SPB is commonly inhibited in telomere clustering-defective cells. However, in <italic>taz1Δ</italic> and <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells, although there was a considerable level of telomere-SPB association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), centromere detachment was inhibited at similar levels to those seen in <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> and <italic>rap1Δ</italic> cells during karyogamy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, Karyogamy; no statistically significant differences among the mutants), in which telomere-SPB association was almost completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This indicates that inhibition of centromere detachment is not correlated with loss of telomere-SPB association.</p>

<title>Kinetochore disassembly is inhibited in telomere clustering-defective mutants</title>
<p>Because centromere detachment is induced by outer kinetochore disassembly, we next examined the localization of Nuf2 and Mis12, which are components of the Ndc80 and Mis12 outer kinetochore complexes, respectively. The outer kinetochore components delocalize from the centromere at the time of centromere detachment, and remain delocalized until kinetochore reformation occurs around the end of the horsetail stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref046">46</xref>].

Mis12 showed similar localization patterns, but with higher observation frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>, WT).

<p>By contrast, in all telomere clustering-defective mutants, Nuf2 and Mis12 signals were frequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3B–3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The higher observation frequencies in the horsetail stage were not due to enrichment of cells in the late, kinetochore-reformation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) because, when we specified early horsetail-stage cells by nuclear signals of RFP-tagged Mrc1, a DNA replication regulator that was observed only in the early meiotic stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), Nuf2 was still observed at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, Horsetail with Mrc1). In addition, the higher observation frequencies were not caused by centromere clustering-dependent increases in signal intensities because the number of centromere signals significantly increased during the horsetail stage in the <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutant [average number of Cnp1 signals was 3.4 ± 1.1 (n = 162) for wild type and 3.9 ± 1.2 (n = 225) for the <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutant during the horsetail stage; p&lt;0.001 by the Student’s t-test]. This indicates that delocalization of the outer kinetochore components is inhibited in the mutants. The retained signals were localized either at the SPB or at the SPB-detached centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3A, S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s004">S4B</xref> Figs) [centromere and/or SPB localization of Nuf2 signals was confirmed by co-localization of the Nuf2 signals with either SPB and/or centromere signals in cells in which both the SPB and centromeres were visualized (n = 73)]. Furthermore, the signals were sometimes co-localized with the centromere-free SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, arrowhead). This indicates that, in addition to the dissociation of kinetochore complexes from the centromere, that from the SPB is also inhibited. We also noticed that localization patterns of the retained signals in the <italic>mto1Δ</italic> mutant were somewhat different from those in other mutants; the signals tended to be localized at SPB-detached centromeres in <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells, but at the SPB in other mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">Fig 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s004">S4B</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>Microtubule disruption inhibits centromere detachment from the SPB</title>
<p>Because telomere clustering depends on microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>], we next examined if microtubule disruption inhibits centromere detachment using a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate (MBC). To disrupt microtubules before telomere clustering, we synchronously induced meiosis using haploid cells bearing both mating-type genes, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>]. These haploid cells underwent meiosis fairly synchronously after a single mitotic division (shown by a transient increase in binuclear cells) in nitrogen-depleted conditions, forming more than two nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s005">S5A–S5C Fig</xref>). We treated the cells with MBC or its solvent DMSO after mitotic division.</p>
<p>In the DMSO-treated control experiment, as the percentage of cells with SPB-associated telomeres increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, WT+DMSO), the percentage of those with SPB-associated centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, WT+DMSO) or Nuf2 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>, WT+DMSO) conversely decreased. This confirms the occurrence of centromere detachment and kinetochore disassembly in addition to telomere clustering. It should also be noted that loss of Bqt1 or Mto1 caused inhibition of telomere clustering, centromere detachment, and kinetochore disassembly in haploid meiotic cells, as shown by the decrease in cells with SPB-associated telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> and <italic>mto1Δ</italic>) and the increase in those with SPB-associated centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> and <italic>mto1Δ</italic>) or Nuf2 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> and <italic>mto1Δ</italic>).

<title>Defective telomere clustering causes equational segregation of sister chromatids at meiosis I</title>
<p>Kinetochore disassembly is thought to be required for establishment of sister kinetochore mono-orientation and protection of centromere cohesion; therefore, we next examined sister chromatid segregation in telomere clustering-defective cells. For this analysis, we used cells that do not form chiasmata because chiasmata promote monopolar attachment of sister chromatids and obscure centromere properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref038">38</xref>]. If the properties of meiosis-specific centromeres are impaired, sister chromatids should undergo equational segregation in chiasma-lacking cells.</p>
<p>GFP visualization of centromeres of one of the homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) showed that sister chromatids rarely underwent equational segregation in <italic>rec12</italic> recombination-deficient, chiasma-lacking zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, +), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref040">40</xref>]. By contrast, introduction of <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> or <italic>mto1Δ</italic> mutation significantly increased equational segregation in <italic>rec12</italic> zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This indicates that the centromere properties are compromised. In chiasma-lacking cells, sister centromeres frequently attach to both SPBs despite mono-orientation of sister kinetochores, but protected centromere cohesion prevents sister chromatid separation. In these cells, <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> mutation, which eliminates cohesion protection, causes frequent equational segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, +) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref038">38</xref>]. Notably, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutation further increased equational segregation in the <italic>rec12Δ sgo1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic>), similar to <italic>moa1Δ</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), which is thought to compromise kinetochore mono-orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref056">56</xref>]. This strongly suggests that <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutation compromises kinetochore mono-orientation. <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutation also increased equational segregation in haploid <italic>rec12</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>), indicating that the increase was not attributed to loss of Rec12 functions.

<title>SPB-recruited Taz1 promotes centromere detachment from the SPB</title>
<p>Telomere clustering causes recruitment of telomere-LINC connectors to the SPB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, Wild type). We therefore hypothesized that an SPB-recruited telomere-LINC connector(s) promotes centromere detachment. Among the telomere-LINC connectors, we suspected that Taz1 contributes to centromere detachment, because in the <italic>taz1Δ</italic> mutant, although telomere-SPB association was substantially retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <italic>taz1Δ</italic>), the observed inhibition of centromere detachment was not statistically different from that observed in <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> or <italic>rap1Δ</italic> cells during karyogamy (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), where telomere-SPB association was almost completely eliminated.

<p>In wild-type cells, Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb was localized in the nucleus during karyogamy with a very low or undetectable level of accumulation at telomeres or the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, WT). Its weak SPB accumulation was probably due to the presence of endogenous intact Taz1. In <italic>taz1Δ</italic> cells, by contrast, Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb accumulated at the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <italic>taz1Δ</italic>, arrowheads) without restoring telomere-SPB association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s007">S7B Fig</xref>, +Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb, <italic>taz1Δ</italic>).

However, Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb did not accumulate at the SPB because Taz1 cannot directly interact with the LINC complex without Bqt1 or Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb, <italic>bqt1Δ</italic>), and it remained unclear if defective SPB recruitment of Taz1 is the cause of the inhibition in these cells. To elucidate this point, we artificially tethered Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb to the SPB by fusing it with almost the entire length of Sad1, a LINC component that constitutively localizes at the SPB (Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb-Sad1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, <italic>bqt1Δ+</italic>Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb-Sad1). Taz1<italic>Δ</italic>myb-Sad1 did not affect cell growth (judged by cell viability and the doubling time) and centromere-SPB association during mitosis.

Taking all these results together, we conclude that SPB-recruited Taz1 promotes centromere detachment from the SPB.

<title>Induction of centromere detachment causes spindle impairment in telomere clustering-defective cells</title>
<p>Our results show the presence of regulatory mechanisms that inhibit centromere detachment from the SPB in the absence of telomere-SPB association. However, the advantages of the mechanisms in meiosis are unclear. It was recently reported that defective telomere clustering causes impairment of spindle formation with detachment of the SPB from the nuclear membrane, and that centromere-SPB association restores spindle formation in the absence of telomere clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref035">35</xref>]. These facts suggest that meiotic spindle formation requires SPB association of either telomeres or centromeres, and that concurrent detachment of telomeres and centromeres from the SPB is harmful for spindle formation. The inhibitory mechanisms of centromere detachment may secure spindle formation by preventing concurrent detachment of centromeres and telomeres. To test this possibility, we observed spindle formation in <italic>taz1Δ</italic> and <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutants, which are partially and fully defective in telomere clustering, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and examined the effects of Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 on spindle formation. If spindle formation requires SPB association of either telomeres or centromeres, Taz1Δmyb-Sad1-dependent elimination of centromere-SPB association should cause impairment of spindle formation in telomere clustering-defective cells, and the extents of the resultant impairments should be correlated with the extents of telomere-clustering defects.</p>
<p>In wild-type cells, meiosis I and II occurred sequentially with the formation of one and two spindles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, WT; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s013">S5 Movie</xref>), and Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 only marginally compromised spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, WT). In <italic>taz1Δ</italic> cells, spindle impairment was not detected, while, in <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> cells, impaired spindle formation together with detachment of the SPB from the nuclear periphery were observed in about half of cases, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>, +None; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s014">S6 Movie</xref>) (we cannot exclude the possibility that the detached SPBs remained connected with the nucleus by Cut11-lacking nuclear membrane). Notably, Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 induced or increased spindle impairment together with SPB detachment from the nuclear periphery in <italic>taz1Δ</italic> and <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>, +Taz1Δmyb-Sad1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s015">S7 Movie</xref>), supporting the importance of centromere-SPB association for spindle formation. In addition, the extents of spindle impairment were correlated with the extents of defective telomere clustering; telomere clustering was more severely impaired in <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> cells than in <italic>taz1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, +Taz1Δmyb-Sad1). These results support the idea that meiotic spindle formation requires SPB association of either telomeres or centromeres, and that the inhibitory mechanisms of centromere detachment secure spindle formation by preventing the concurrent detachment of centromeres and telomeres. The SPB was frequently missing at one (monopolar) or both (nonpolar) spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s014">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s015">S7</xref> Movies). This may mean that telomere/centromere-SPB association is critical for anchoring the SPB to the spindle pole.</p>

<title>Regulation of centromere detachment from the SPB and its role in meiosis.</title>
<p>(A) Regulation of centromere detachment from the SPB. Telomere clustering causes SPB recruitment of Taz1, and SPB-recruited Taz1 promotes centromere detachment from the SPB. SPB- and telocentrosome-nucleated microtubules, which drive telomere clustering, also promote centromere detachment. Ndc80C: Ndc80 complex; Mis12C: Mis12 complex. (B) A role of telomere-dependent regulation of centromere detachment in meiosis. During mitosis centromeres are attached to the SPB, while telomeres are located away from it (Rabl). Centromeres become detached from the SPB after clustering of telomeres at the SPB, forming the bouquet chromosome arrangement (Bouquet). When telomere clustering is impaired, the Taz1- and/or microtubule-dependent regulatory mechanism inhibits centromere detachment, preventing concomitant detachment of centromeres and telomeres from the SPB, which is harmful for spindle formation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Two facts indicate that the contribution of microtubules is Taz1-independent. First, in cells with a disorganized microtubule network, despite occasional recruitment of Taz1 to the SPB, centromere detachment was inhibited to a level comparable to that in cells in which SPB recruitment of Taz1 was completely defective. Second, Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 failed to restore centromere detachment in <italic>mto1Δ</italic> or MBC-treated cells. Thus, telomere clustering-dependent SPB recruitment of Taz1 and microtubules independently promote centromere detachment in bouquet formation. Taz1- and microtubule-dependent regulatory mechanisms probably inhibit centromere detachment when telomere clustering is impaired.</p>
<p>One likely scenario for Taz1-dependent centromere regulation is that Taz1 recruits a factor(s) to the SPB that promotes centromere detachment by inducing dissociation of outer kinetochore complexes from the centromere and SPB. The promoting factor is perhaps activated or induced by mating pheromone-dependent MAP kinase because, in the absence of mating pheromone signaling, centromeres remain attached to the SPB despite clustering of telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref039">39</xref>]. Aurora kinase is a potential candidate for the modifying factor because this kinase induces centromere detachment from the SPB in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref061">61</xref>]. Another candidate is Polo-like kinase because it regulates meiotic kinetochore mono-orientation and centromere cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref062">62</xref>]. However, it is currently unclear if these kinases contribute to centromere detachment.</p>
<p>Although Taz1 is important, we cannot exclude the possibility that a different telomere-associated factor(s) additionally contributes to centromere detachment. Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 did not appear to completely restore centromere detachment in the telomere clustering-defective mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Furthermore, the retention level of SPB-centromere association or Nuf2/Mis12 centromere localization in the <italic>taz1Δ</italic> mutant was slightly lower than that in the <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> or <italic>rap1Δ</italic> mutant (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3B Fig</xref>, Horsetail). These facts may mean the contribution of a different telomere-associated factor to centromere detachment.</p>
<p>How microtubules contribute to centromere detachment remains elusive. Given the requirement of telomere- and/or SPB-nucleated microtubules for telomere clustering, we speculate that efficient centromere detachment requires the telomere/SPB-nucleated microtubules. In <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells, γ-TuC telomere/SPB localization and telomere/SPB-microtubule interaction are not completely eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>], and the remaining telomere/SPB-nucleated microtubules may account for why inhibition of kinetochore disassembly appeared to be weaker in <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells than in MBC-treated cells. It is possible that the telomere/SPB-nucleated microtubules recruit a cytoplasmic factor(s) to telomeres and/or the SPB, which activates a centromere detachment-promoting factor in the nucleus, perhaps via the LINC. Alternatively, microtubule-lacking, LINC-accumulated telomeres may generate inhibitory signals for centromere detachment, as spindle-unattached centromeres do for metaphase-anaphase transition in the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway. In either case, the regulatory mechanism is probably different from the Taz1-dependent mechanism because the localization patterns of retained kinetochore components differ between cells lacking telomere-LINC connectors and those defective in microtubule formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g004">4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006304.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Impairment of meiotic centromere formation by telomere-clustering defects</title>
<p>Kinetochore disassembly is thought to be required for establishment of kinetochore mono-orientation and protection of centromere cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref040">40</xref>]. Our finding that equational segregation of sister chromatids at meiosis I increased in chiasma-lacking, telomere clustering-defective cells, where kinetochore disassembly is inhibited, supported this idea. In telomere clustering-defective cells, kinetochore mono-orientation is probably compromised because equational segregation is increased in <italic>sgo1Δ rec12Δ</italic> zygotes. It was recently reported that the centromeric histone H3 variant Cnp1 and the heterochromatin protein 1 orthologue Swi6 frequently fail to localize at centromeres in telomere clustering-defective cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref048">48</xref>]. This may mean that kinetochore disassembly also contributes to the proper localization of central centromeric components, and that impaired centromere localization of the central components may cause kinetochore mono-orientation defects. However, if inhibition of kinetochore disassembly induces Cnp1 delocalization, it probably occurs after the horsetail stage because the number of Cnp1 signals was increased during the horsetail stage in the <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> mutant.</p>

<title>Importance of a regulatory link between centromere detachment and telomere clustering for spindle formation</title>
<p>We showed that Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 induces or increases impairment of spindle formation in telomere clustering-defective <italic>taz1Δ</italic> and <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> cells. Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 induced centromere detachment in these cells; therefore, retention of centromere-SPB association is probably important for spindle formation in the absence of telomere-SPB association. This finding agrees with previous findings that defective telomere clustering causes spindle impairment and that SPB association of centromeres can substitute for SPB association of telomeres and promote spindle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref035">35</xref>]. Considering these facts together with the strong correlation of the extents of spindle defects with those of defective telomere/centromere-SPB association, we conclude that concurrent detachment of both telomeres and centromeres from the SPB causes spindle impairment, and propose that the Taz1- and microtubule-dependent inhibitory mechanisms of centromere detachment secure proper spindle formation by preventing such harmful detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006304.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Microtubule disruption is caused by various environmental factors such as low temperature and osmotic stress; therefore, telomere clustering is probably often inhibited in nature. Despite the inhibition of meiotic centromere formation, cells may have evolved the inhibitory mechanisms of centromere detachment to secure spindle formation.</p>
<p>How telomere/centromere-SPB association contributes to spindle formation is unclear. It was reported that loss of telomere-SPB association leads to decrease in Sad1 at the SPB, and that forced SPB interaction of centromeres restores SPB localization of Sad1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref035">35</xref>]. Given these observations, it was suggested that telomere/centromere-SPB association is required for proper Sad1 localization at the SPB. The decrease in Sad1 at the SPB may account for the dissociation of the SPB from the spindle pole as well as from the nuclear periphery observed in our analyses. Because abolishment of SPB movements restores spindle formation in telomere clustering-defective cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref063">63</xref>], in the absence of telomere/centromere-SPB association, SPB movements may disrupt Sad1 interaction with the nuclear membrane, reducing Sad1 localization at the SPB. Alternatively, defective SPB recruitment of telomere- or centromere-associated factors that regulate Sad1 localization may cause the reduction.</p>
<p>Several facts raise the possibility that similar regulatory mechanisms are present in other organisms. First, meiotic telomere clustering depends on the LINC complexes in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref043">43</xref>]. Second, in mouse oocytes, kinetochore disassembly probably also occurs, because some of the outer kinetochore complexes are not localized at centromeres before meiotic divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref064">64</xref>]. Third, a telomere-binding protein, Ndj1, which contributes to telomere clustering, regulates meiotic spindle formation by interacting with the SUN-domain protein Mps3 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref066">66</xref>], suggesting the presence of a regulatory relationship between telomeres and spindle formation. Although these facts suggest conservation of the mechanisms, at least in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, microtubule-dependent regulation of centromere detachment is apparently missing because microtubule disruption causes centromere detachment from the SPB and induces meiotic centromere formation unlike the situation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref041">41</xref>]. Although conservation of the regulatory mechanisms is currently unclear, there is no doubt that our findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of meiosis, because telomere and centromere positions play crucial roles in proper meiotic chromosome segregation. Furthermore, chromosome positioning changes dynamically during development and differentiation and contributes to various chromosomal events in many different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref005">5</xref>], and our findings may also be relevant for understanding the chromosome positioning-dependent mechanisms that regulate development and differentiation of other organisms.</p>

<title>Expression of an N-terminal portion of Taz1 and its artificial tethering to the SPB</title>
<p>To express an N-terminal portion of Taz1 (Taz1Δmyb), a plasmid bearing a gene encoding Taz1Δmyb was constructed using the integration plasmid pMY23, which encodes an mCherry and <italic>taz1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> fusion and the <italic>aur1</italic><sup><italic>r</italic></sup> gene as a selectable marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>]. The region that encodes a myb domain of Taz1 in pMY23 was first deleted using the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), generating pJM4. Briefly, a DNA fragment that encodes Taz1Δmyb and mCherry was amplified by PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, 5’-TTCTCTTCTCAGATTATCACCCTCT-3’ and 5’-AGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAACAGCA-3’, and pMY23 as a template.

<title>Effects of <italic>moa1Δ</italic> mutation on sister chromatid segregation in chiasma-lacking <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> zygotes.</title>
<p>The frequencies of equational segregation of sister chromatids at meiosis I in <italic>rec12Δ sgo1Δ</italic> diploid zygotes. Sister chromatid segregation was analyzed by visualizing the centromere-proximal <italic>lys1</italic> locus of chromosome I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref074">74</xref>]. It should be noted that chromosome I undergoes equational segregation more frequently than chromosome II in the <italic>rec12Δ sgo1Δ</italic> background due probably to different centromere structures and/or chromosome lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref038">38</xref>].</p>

<title>Schematic diagram of the predicted localization of telomere-LINC connectors and Taz1Δmyb fragments and effects of Taz1Δmyb fragments on telomere-SPB association and Nuf2 localization.</title>
<p>(A) Predicted localization of telomere-LINC connectors and Taz1Δmyb fragments in various types of cells. In wild-type cells, the telomere-LINC connectors are recruited to the SPB by telomere clustering at the SPB (Wild type). In <italic>taz1Δ</italic> cells, the telomere-LINC connectors other than Taz1 are probably recruited to the SPB by occasional telomere-SPB association. Rap1 interacts with a Sad1 interactor Bqt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>]; therefore, telomere-free Rap1 may also interact with the SPB through the Bqt1-Bqt2 complex. Taz1Δmyb likely localizes at the SPB through interaction with Rap1 but not with telomeres in <italic>taz1Δ</italic> cells (<italic>taz1Δ</italic> + Taz1Δmyb). In <italic>bqt1Δ</italic> cells, the telomere-LINC connectors are probably not recruited to the SPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref010">10</xref>], but Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 is probably able to localize at the SPB via Sad1 (<italic>bqt1Δ</italic> + Taz1Δmyb-Sad1). In <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells, LINC connectors and the LINC complex accumulate at telomeres, but due to defective telomere microtubule nucleation, telomere clustering is defective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006304.ref045">45</xref>]. Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 is probably localized at telomeres as well as the SPB (<italic>mto1Δ</italic> + Taz1Δmyb-Sad1). Poz1/Tpz1/Pot1: a complex of Poz1, Tpz1, and Pot1; mCh: mCherry molecule. (B) Localization patterns of the telomere-adjacent <italic>sod2</italic> locus during karyogamy in wild-type and telomere clustering-defective cells expressing Taz1Δmyb (+Taz1Δmyb) or Taz1Δmyb-Sad1 (+Taz1Δmyb-Sad1). Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of examined cells. (C) Population of Taz1Δmyb- (+Taz1Δmyb) or Taz1Δmyb-Sad1-expressing (+Taz1Δmyb-Sad1) cells with different Nuf2 localization. At SPB: one SPB-associated signal; Off/at SPB: SPB-associated and SPB-dissociated signals; Off SPB: SPB-dissociated signals. Images in the box show the representative localization of the SPB and signals.</p>
