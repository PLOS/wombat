<p>MicroRNAs play key roles in tumor metastasis. Here, we describe the regulation and function of miR-218 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. miR-218 expression is decreased along with the expression of one of its host genes, Slit3 in metastatic GC. However, Robo1, one of several Slit receptors, is negatively regulated by miR-218, thus establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, which activates the Slit-Robo1 pathway through the interaction between Robo1 and Slit2, thus triggering tumor metastasis. The restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our results describe a Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit whose disruption may contribute to GC metastasis. Targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>MicroRNAs have been identified as playing important roles in tumor metastasis, but their impact on GC metastasis has been poorly explored. We have discovered miR-218, which functions as a suppressor of tumor metastasis and is correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis in patients with GC. Our results show that miR-218 is part of a regulatory circuit involving the Slit-Robo1 pathway. In metastatic tumor cells, miR-218 was suppressed along with Slit3, one of its host genes. Meanwhile, Robo1, one of several Slit receptors, is upregulated in response to the decrease in miR-218, which in turn induced a reactive upregulation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway through an interaction with Slit2, thus facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion. Such findings not only provide new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC but also provide evidence for a novel miRNA–mediated regulatory mode of receptor signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have led to excellent expectations for long-term survival for early gastric cancer (GC). However, the prognosis for advanced GC with extensive invasion and metastasis remains poor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Oue1">[1]</xref>. In order to metastasize, tumor cells must pass through a series of sequential and selective events, including detachment, migration, local invasion, angiogenesis, intravasation, survival in the circulatory system, extravasation, and regrowth in different organs. In the metastatic cascade, invasion of GC into the surrounding tissue is a crucial early step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Gupta1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Steeg1">[4]</xref><bold>.</bold> However, the mechanisms of invasion have not yet been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>A large number of microribonucleic acids (microRNAs or miRNAs) have been recently implicated in cancer metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Nicoloso1">[5]</xref>, including miR-10b, miR-21, miR-126, miR-335, miR-373, miR-146, miR-520c, and miR-205 in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Ma1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Hurst1">[11]</xref>; miR-224 and miR-21 in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Prueitt1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Li1">[13]</xref>; miR-29c in nasopharyngeal carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Sengupta1">[14]</xref>; miR-10a, miR-222, miR-125b, miR-7, and miR-452 in urothelial carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Veerla1">[15]</xref>; miR-182 in melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Segura1">[16]</xref>; miR-92b and miR-9/9* in brain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Nass1">[17]</xref>; and miR-21 in colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Asangani1">[18]</xref>. However, very few miRNAs known to be involved in GC metastasis have been reported. miRNAs are naturally occurring, short, non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Lewis1">[19]</xref>. In mammals, mature miRNAs are generated from pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs via sequential processing by Drosha and Dicer and are found in many organisms. They consist of 21–24 nucleotides, integrate into RNA-inducing silencing complexes, and pair with the 3′ untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of specific target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to suppress translation or induce degradation of the target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Lai1">[20]</xref>. Emerging evidence has revealed that miRNAs play key roles in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, stress resistance, fat metabolism, tumorigenesis, and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Kloosterman1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Lu1">[23]</xref>. A better understanding of the changes in miRNA expression during GC invasion may lead to a better understanding of GC development, as well as possible improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of advanced GC.</p>
<p>In the present study, we established high (MKN28-M and SGC7901-M) and low invasive cell sublines (MKN28-NM and SGC7901-NM) using a repetitive transwell assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. We then examined the global miRNA expression profile in each cell subline using a miRNA microarray to identify differentially expressed miRNAs related to human GC invasion. In total, 45 miRNAs were shown to be differentially expressed in invasive vs. non-invasive GC cells. Among these, miR-218, a significantly downregulated miRNA in highly invasive cells, was shown to be closely correlated with GC tumorigenesis and metastasis in patients. More recently, a decrease in miR-218 has been reported in several kinds of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, GC, lung cancer, and cervical carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Volinia1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Yanaihara1">[27]</xref>, but this decrease in miRNA-218 was simply screened out as being one of the dozens of potential miRNAs of interest in the cancers described above. No further studies have been performed to assess the significance of miR-218 in tumor metastasis. Here, we have found that decreased miR-218 expression was correlated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in patients, and re-expression of miR-218 in metastatic cells was able to inhibit migration, invasion, and metastasis formation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a bioinformatics search for miR-218 targets, we pinpointed the receptor Robo1 as miR-218's functional target, and we confirmed that the interaction between miR-218 and Robo1 was crucial to GC cell motility by demonstrating that there was an inverse correlation between miR-218 and Robo1 in GC cell lines as well as in GC patients. Furthermore, we discovered an intriguing negative feedback loop involving Slit, miR-218, and Robo1, in which miR-218 can be derived from either of two genes located in the introns of two distinct members of the Slit protein family. In addition, members of this family are ligands of the Robo1 receptor. We demonstrated that expression of the two miRNA precursor genes (miR-218-1 and miR-218-2) correlated with expression of the host genes (Slit2 and Slit3, respectively) and that the mature miR-218 was mainly derived from the miR-218-2 precursor, with a concomitant reduction of host Slit3 but not of Slit2 in metastatic GC cells. Thus, upregulation of Robo1 in response to the decrease in miR-218 induced a reactive upregulation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway through its interaction with Slit2, thus facilitating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Our findings not only provide new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC, but they also revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling.</p>

<title>Establishment and characterization of cell sublines with different invasive and metastatic potentials</title>
<p>To establish the GC metastasis models, we created invasive and non-invasive cell sublines from the human GC cell lines SGC7901 and MKN28 using the repeated transwell approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Briefly, a repetitive invasion assay was performed, and those cells that failed to invade the membranes and cells that had the ability to migrate through the collagen-coated membrane in all selection rounds were separated. After ten rounds of selection, we obtained invasive (MKN28-M and SGC7901-M) and non-invasive cell sublines (MKN28-NM and SGC7901-NM). The metastatic properties of each cell subline were then characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, migration ability of MKN28-M cells was approximately 4-fold greater than that of MKN28-NM cells. Likewise, the invasive potential was about 5-fold greater for MKN28-M cells as compared to MKN28-NM cells. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, tumor cell metastasis was observed in nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>, almost no metastatic GC cells were detected in the lungs or livers of nude mice at 10 weeks after injection of MKN28-NM cells, whereas most of the mice injected with MKN28-M cells displayed obvious lung or liver metastases. Similar results were observed for SGC7901-M and SGC7901-NM cells (data not shown). No significant differences in cell proliferation or cell-cycle distribution were observed among these cell sublines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s009">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s002">S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of metastasis-related miRNAs by array-based hybridization</title>
<p>To identify miRNAs potentially involved in GC invasion, we examined global miRNA expression in each cell subline using the microRNA array (v.10.0, Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark), which consists of 847 capture probes for mature human miRNAs. The microarray results revealed that the expression of 124 miRNAs significantly differed between the highly invasive variant MKN28-M and the non-invasive cell subline MKN28-NM. Of these, 83 were upregulated and 41 were downregulated. Compared with SGC7901-NM, 62 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the SGC7901-M cell subline, including 47 downregulated and 15 upregulated miRNAs. In total, 11 miRNAs were found to be upregulated and 34 miRNAs were downregulated in both MKN28-M and SGC7901-M cells compared with those in the corresponding non-invasive sublines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 45 differentially regulated miRNAs, miR-218 was one of those that displayed significantly differential expression. miR-218 has been reported to be downregulated in cervical cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Martinez1">[25]</xref>, GC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Petrocca1">[26]</xref>, lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Yanaihara1">[27]</xref> and prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Leite1">[28]</xref>, indicating possible involvement in both oncogenic transformation and tumor metastasis. However, miRNA-218 was only one of the many potential miRNAs of interest in cancers. In this work, miR-218 has been investigated in much greater detail. To validate the microarray results, we assessed miR-218 expression in the GC cell sublines previously mentioned and in the immortal gastric epithelial cell line GES using qRT–PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-He1">[29]</xref>. miR-218 expression was significantly decreased in MKN28-M and SGC7901-M cells and was lower in all four GC cell sublines compared to immortalized human gastric epithelial GES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we compared miR-218 expression in the primary GC tumor vs. the metastatic lymph nodes in 10 patients with stage III/IV GC using qRT–PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, mature miR-218 levels were significantly decreased in 7 out of 10 metastatic lymph nodes, indicating that miR-218 may play a causal role in GC metastasis.</p>

<title>Decreased miR-218 expression in GC was associated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor patient prognosis</title>
<p>To determine the potential clinicopathological implications of altered miR-218 expression, we investigated the expression levels of miR-218 in 40 GC tissues (T) and non-tumor mucosa (N) b<bold>y</bold> qRT–PCR. The term -ΔCt was used to describe the expression level of miR-218. Consistent with the above data, the results verified that the miR-218 expression level in GC (-13.81±0.15, mean ± SE) tissues was significantly lower than that in non-neoplastic mucosa (-11.62±0.15, mean ± SE) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, t = 10.62, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Correlations between the miR-218 expression level and clinicopathologic characteristics of GC are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000879-t001">Table 1</xref>. Statistically significant associations between the miR-218 expression level and clinical stage and between the miR-218 expression level and GC metastasis were observed in this study. The median expression of miR-218 was −14.25±0.17 in the 22 cases with advanced stage (stage III and IV) disease, whereas the median expression was −13.27±0.20 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0010, Mann-Whitney test) in the 18 cases with early-stage (stages I and II) disease. In the 29 cases of GC with lymph node metastasis, the median expression of miR-218 was −14.09±0.16, which was significantly lower than the median expression (−13.07±0.24) in the 11 non-metastatic GC cases (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0036). The expression of miR-218 in GC patients did not correlate with age, gender, tumor size, or cell differentiation. Moreover, we examined whether the level of miR-218 expression was associated with survival in patients with GC. Patients were subsequently divided into low expression (n = 20) and high expression groups (n = 20) based on miR-218 levels greater or less than the mean (−13.81) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Kaplan–Meier survival analyses revealed that patients whose primary tumors displayed low expression of miR-218 had a shorter median survival time. The three-year survival rate of patients with low miR-218 expression was 30%, which was significantly lower than the survival rate in patients with high miR-218 expression (65%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0012, log-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Ectopic expression of miR-218 inhibited tumor cell invasion and metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To study the role of miR-218 in GC metastasis, MKN28-M cells were transfected with pGenesil-1-miR-218 or a control vector expressing a nonspecific miRNA, cel-miR-67, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were then selected with 400 mg/L G418 to generate MKN28-M-miR-218 and MKN28-M-miR-control stable cells. We found that ectopic expression of miR-218 resulted in an approximately three-fold reduction in migration and invasiveness. To determine whether the loss of miR-218 would promote the migration or invasion of cancer cells, we silenced miR-218 with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor in the MKN28-NM cell line, resulting in a three- to four-fold increase in cell migration and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). To test if inhibition of tumor invasion by miR-218 is caused by impairing the invasive ability of tumor cells, we excluded the effect of miR-218 on the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of gastric cancer cells. Over-expression of miR-218 did not affect the proliferation and the cell cycle distribution of MKN28-M cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s005">Figure S5A and S5D</xref>). To further investigate the inhibition of <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor metastasis by miR-218, we implanted MKN28-M-miR-218 cells that were stably expressing miR-218 or control cells into nude mice through the lateral tail vein. Lung and liver metastasis of GC was apparent in mice injected with MKN28-M-miR-control cells. In contrast, few metastatic tumors were detected in mice injected with MKN28-M-miR-218 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, we simultaneously observed the growth of the primary tumors and the incidence of distant metastasis in the nude mice injected subcutaneously with MKN28-M-miR-218 cells or control cells. The results showed lung or liver metastasis was apparent in 3 out of 10 mice injected with MKN28-M-miR-control cells; in stark contrast, no metastasis were found in mice injected with MKN28-M-miR-218 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). These results are consistent with data obtained from tail vein assays that assess cancer metastasis and indicate that miR-218 has the ability to suppress metastasis without affecting cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Robo1 was a direct functional target of miR-218 in GC metastasis</title>
<p>To assess how a low level of miR-218 expression contributes to the invasion and metastasis of GC, we searched for the potential regulatory targets of miR-218 using prediction tools, including miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan. Although hundreds of different targets were predicted, those genes involved in migration or invasion may be the relevant targets with respect to the biological functions of miR-218. We then performed a functional classification of the predicted targets using the DAVID program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Of these genes, Robo1 is regarded as a proto-oncogene and harbors migration-promoting activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Wang1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Legg1">[35]</xref>. Mertsch <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that Robo1 facilitates glioma cell migration mediated by Slit2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Mertsch1">[36]</xref>. Schmid <italic>et al.</italic> found that breast tumor cell migration is induced by the Slit2-Robo1 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Schmid1">[37]</xref>. These findings suggest that Robo1 may be a target for miR-218. To further test our hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of miR-218 and Robo1 in GES and in non-invasive (MKN28-NM and SGC7901-NM) and invasive (MKN28-M and SGC7901-M) GC cells. The results showed a negative correlation between the levels of miR-218 and Robo1 mRNA in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that Robo1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5B2</xref>) levels were decreased when miR-218 was expressed by pGenesil-1-miR-218 in MKN28-M cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5B1</xref>). The reverse was observed for Robo1 expression when miR-218 was knocked down in MKN28-NM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5C1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5C2</xref>). The inverse relationship between miR-218 and Robo1 expression was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s009">Text S1</xref>) in 40 cases of gastric cancer, in matched adjacent normal tissues that were also used in clinicopathological studies, and in 29 matched metastases. The results show that Robo1 was upregulated in GC, especially in metastatic GC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000879.s004">Figure S4</xref>), in which miR-218 has a relatively low expression.</p>
<p>To obtain further direct evidence that Robo1 is a target of miR-218, we investigated the binding site of miR-218 in the 3′-UTR of Robo1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We constructed a luciferase reporter (Luc-Robo1) in which the nucleotides of the Robo1 3′-UTR complementary to miR-218 (nt 971–978) were inserted into the pMIR-REPORT miRNA expression reporter vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Gramantieri1">[38]</xref>. Correspondingly, we also generated both a mutant reporter (Luc-Robo1-mu), in which the first six nucleotides in the miR-218 seed-region complementary sites were deleted, and a control reporter, which contained a non-related fragment of cDNA (Luc-Ctrl). miR-218-expression plasmids were co-transfected with Luc-Robo1, Luc-Robo1-mu, or Luc-Ctrl into MKN28-M cells. The assays showed that the luciferase activity in the Luc-Robo1-transfected cells was significantly decreased compared to the luciferase activity in the mutant and negative control cells (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), suggesting that miR-218 reduced the luciferase activity of Luc-Robo1 but had no effect on Luc-Robo1-mu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the inserted fragment of Robo1 (nt 971<italic>–</italic>978) was the target of miR-218.</p>

<title>miR-218 targeted Robo1 by binding to its 3′-UTR.</title>
<p>(A) The Robo1 3′-UTR was a potential target of miR-218. (B and C) miR-218 and Robo1 levels were analyzed by qRT–PCR and western blot, respectively. Robo1 levels decreased when miR-218 was upregulated in response to the miR-218-expression vector in MKN28-M cells, whereas the reverse was observed for Robo1 expression when miR-218 was knocked down in MKN28-NM cells. (D) MKN28-M cells were co-transfected with miR-218 and a luciferase reporter (Luc-Robo1) containing a fragment of the Robo1 3′-UTR harboring either the miR-218 binding site or a mutant (Luc-Robo1<italic>-</italic>mu) in which the first six nucleotides of the miR-218 binding site were deleted. A luciferase reporter construct engineered with a non-related fragment of cDNA was used as a negative control (Luc-control). The assays showed that luciferase activity in the Luc-Robo1 group was significantly decreased compared to the luciferase activity of the mutant and negative control groups. (E) MKN28-M-miR-218 cells, which stably over-expressed miR-218, were transiently transfected with a Robo1 expression construct or a Robo1 mutant construct lacking the miR-218 binding site. MKN28-M cells were transfected with Robo1 siRNA or a negative control siRNA. Western blot analysis for Robo1 showed that co-transfection of miR-218 and the Robo1 mutant construct produced higher levels of Robo1 protein than co-transfection of miR-218 and the Robo1 construct. Robo1 siRNA effectively reduced the amount Robo1 protein observed. (F) The cell invasion assay indicated that Robo1 mutant constructs could reverse the effect of miR-218-mediated suppression of cell invasion. Knockdown of Robo1 by siRNA in MKN28-M cells inhibited cell invasion. * <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

<p>Robo1 has been shown to be over-expressed in cancer cells and is known to promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis via an interaction with Slit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Seth1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Abdollahi1">[40]</xref>. To test whether Robo1 is functionally regulated by miR-218, we generated a Robo1 expression construct containing only a fragment of the predicted miR-218 binding site and Robo1 mutant expression vector entirely lacking the 3′-UTR. We also made the Robo1 siRNA. MKN28-M-miR-218 cells, which stably expressed miR-218 ectopically, were transiently transfected with the Robo1 construct or the mutant construct (with no miR-218 binding site), and MKN28-M cells were transfected with Robo1 siRNA or a negative control siRNA. MKN28-M-miR-218 cells transfected with the Robo1 mutant construct showed a 3.8-fold increase in invasion ability compared to cells transfected with the Robo1 construct. These results indicate that introduction of mutant Robo1 cDNA that lacked the miR-218 binding site into the miR-218-overexpressing cells reversed the effect of miR-218-mediated suppression of cell invasion. However, the effect of Robo1 was repressed by miR-218 in the presence of the Robo1 3′-UTR containing the miR-218 binding sites. Knockdown of Robo1 by siRNA in MKN28-M cells inhibited cell invasion, which fell to levels similar to those observed after transfection with the miR-218-expressing vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g005">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>). These observations suggest that miR-218 directly suppresses Robo1-mediated cell invasion.</p>

<title>Slit2, but not Slit3, can interact with Robo1, enriched by the absence of miR-218, to promote GC invasion</title>
<p>Two types of miRNAs exist: intergenic and intronic. The former are located in non-coding regions between genes, and their corresponding pri-miRNAs are generally transcribed from their own promoters by RNA polymerase II. The latter are located within the introns of host genes, and their biogenesis is controlled by the host gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Shi1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Lin1">[42]</xref>. miR-218 is an intronic miRNA. Two genes code for mature miR-218, miR-218-1 and miR-218-2, which are located within intron 15 of Slit2 and intron 14 of Slit3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The intronic location of the two miR-218 genes prompted us to ask whether miR-218-1 and miR-218-2 are transcribed together with their host gene mRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we used qRT-PCR to examine the expression of the miR-218-1 precursor, the miR-218-2 precursor, mature miR-218, Slit2 mRNA, and Slit3 mRNA in the GC tissues used in the survival analysis. Statistical analysis of the correlation coefficient of the qRT-PCR results revealed a significant positive correlation between the levels of Slit2 mRNA and miR-218-1 and between the levels of Slit3 mRNA and miR-218-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). These results indicate that the miR-218 coding genes, miR-218-1 and miR-218-2, are transcribed together with their host genes, Slit2 and Slit3, respectively. A significant positive correlation between the levels of miR-218 and miR-218-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) was seen in GC; however, no such correlation was seen between the levels of miR-218 and miR-218-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that downregulation of miR-218 in GC is promoted by a decrease in miR-218-2, but not in miR-218-1. Consistent with this conclusion, Slit3 expression was significantly reduced in GC (−22.43±0.21, mean ± SE) compared to normal gastric tissue (−20.79±0.23, mean ± SE), (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, t = 7.67, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), whereas Slit2 expression was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0772, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). In summary, our experimental results suggest that significant upregulation of the Robo1 gene in response to removal of miR-218 may induce a subsequent upregulation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway through its interaction with Slit2, facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To study a disease, it is vital to construct an ideal model. In the present study, we isolated invasive and non-invasive cell subpopulations from established human GC cell lines using the repeated transwell approach, which has been successfully applied in many studies investigating tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Chu1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Yu1">[48]</xref>. The results of metastatic examination <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that the established cell sublines had distinct invasive and metastatic capabilities. Here, we screened not only cell sublines derived from GC cell lines with high-invasive potential, but also those with low-invasive potential. With the exception of their metastatic abilities, the selected cell sublines were both quite similar, since they share the same genetic background. Since the major difference between the two types of sublines is metastatic capability, the genes that differ between them should correlate well with metastasis. Moreover, our method is able to distinguish invasion stages from metastasis and enables the study of specific steps in metastasis, which cannot be assessed in the live-animal model.</p>
<p>Recently, miRNAs have been reported to promote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Zhu1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Hiyoshi1">[50]</xref> or suppress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Crawford1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Gebeshuber1">[54]</xref> tumor metastasis, providing a new perspective on the metastatic process. Nonetheless, the role of miRNAs in GC metastasis is lacking. In this report, we explored and obtained for the first time 45 metastasis-related miRNAs in GC based on a well-established metastasis cell model. The finding that miR-218 was downregulated in metastatic GC is intriguing, as decreased miR-218 levels have been reported in several types of solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Volinia1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Yanaihara1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Dalmay1">[55]</xref>, indicating that the loss of miR-218 may be a common event in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we focused on the effect of miR-218 on GC metastasis and demonstrated that miR-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in GC metastasis. Restoration of miR-218 reduced cell migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. To obtain stable cell lines that over-expressed miR-218, we transfected MKN28-M cells with miR-218 plasmids and screened by G418. We selected twelve cell colonies in the miR-218-transfected group and found 10 out of 12 colonies exhibited remarkably uniform, stable and high-level expression of miR-218. Furthermore, three randomly chosen monoclonal cell lines exhibited similar reduction in invasive ablility. However, plasmid transfection strategies often result in lower integration efficiency compared to viral expression leading to the possibility of stochastic selection of rare functionally heterogeneous variants from the initial bulk population. Therefore the future use of viral expression systems should create a more unbiased starting population to test our hypothesis.</p>
<p>As part of our research on how the loss of miR-218 affects GC metastasis, we demonstrated that Robo1 was a critical downstream target of miR-218. It is known that Robo is an axon guidance receptor for Slit and is conserved in animals ranging from fruit flies to mammals. In mammals, three Slit (Slit1–3) and four Robo (Robo1–4) genes have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Huminiecki1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Brose1">[57]</xref>.

For instance, in breast carcinoma tissue samples, Robo1 has been shown to be over-expressed, and it has been demonstrated to induce migration of breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Schmid1">[37]</xref>. Slit2-Robo1 signaling facilitates glioma cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Mertsch1">[36]</xref> and is involved in angiogenesis by increasing microvessel density and tumor mass in a tumor xenograft model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Wang1">[30]</xref>. Wang <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that the over-expression of Robo1 in new blood vessels in tumors induces cancer neovascularization and growth via an interaction between Robo1 and its ligand, Slit2. They also identified phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K) as a downstream effector of Slit2/Robo1 signaling. This suggests that there exists a Slit–Robo1–PI-3K cascade that could lead to the generation of phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate and the subsequent activation of small GTPases that mediate cell movement and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Wang1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Legg1">[35]</xref>. In contrast, other studies have argued that the downregulation of Robo1 caused by deletions or epigenetic modifications may play a role in tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Dallol1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Jin1">[73]</xref>. We propose that a tissue-specific expression pattern exists for the Slit-Robo genes.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found that Robo1 was often expressed at high levels in invasive cells and at low levels in non-invasive cells, whereas miR-218 displayed the opposite expression pattern. When we transfected the miR-218-expression vector and inhibiting oligonucleotides into MKN28-M and MKN28-NM cells, respectively, an inverse expression pattern was observed between miR-218 and Robo1, that is, if miR-218 expression was high, Robo1 expression was low and vice versa. This result was further confirmed in clinical samples and in luciferase activity assays. We also noticed that induction of expression of Robo1 by the Robo1 mutant construct without the miR-218 binding site could reverse miR-218-mediated suppression of tumor cell invasion. In contrast, knockdown of Robo1 gene expression by RNAi had an effect on reducing tumor cell invasion similar to that of the restoration of miR-218, although Robo1 knockdown alone demonstrated a weak effect. This could be because Robo1 is not the only target of miR-218 that is relevant to tumor metastasis. These findings indicate that the invasion suppression effect of miR-218 is at least partly mediated through a decrease in Robo1 expression. This is also the first study to show that the tumor-associated gene Robo1 is negatively regulated by miR-218 via a specific target site (nt 971–978) within the 3′-UTR. The Robo1 receptor is crucial for the response to extracellular signals and cellular phenotypic changes; therefore, tight regulation of the Robo1 receptor by miR-218 may facilitate more robust signal transduction. Anti-Robo1 monoclonal antibody has been reported to be an effective treatment for Robo1-expressing cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Wang1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Ito1">[33]</xref>. In the present study, we found a new inhibitor of Robo1, miR-218, that may potentially be used to treat some types of cancer.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Slit1, Slit2, and Slit3 comprise the Slit family of proteins. Although the genes overlap, their expression patterns and functions are distinct. The former two proteins are known to be involved in axon guidance and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Schmid1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Andrews1">[74]</xref>, while Slit3 is involved in the development of organs and organ systems, including the diaphragm and the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Liu1">[75]</xref>. In agreement with these data, we found that Slit2, but not Slit3, interacted with Robo1 to promote GC invasion.</p>
<p>In addition, we demonstrated that the miR-218 coding genes were located in and transcribed together with Slit genes, which were Robo1 ligands, thus creating a negative feedback loop that regulates Slit/Robo1 signaling. Sailen Barik demonstrated that an intronic miRNA, miR-338, silenced genes that are functionally antagonistic to its host gene product, thus creating a positive feedback loop that assists in the physiological role of the host gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000879-Barik1">[76]</xref>. However, a miRNA hosted in a ligand gene that simultaneously targets its corresponding receptor gene has never been reported. We have identified a negative regulatory loop involving the ligand (host gene), the intronic miRNA, and the receptor, in which the miRNA is co-transcribed with the ligand while receptor expression is repressed. The associations among ligand/receptor and intronic miRNA indicate that the early steps in the information flow may have built-in controls to limit excess signal propagation, which include a negative feedback loop to preserve homeostasis. This regulatory model, which is based on intronic miRNAs, is a novel mechanism of regulation in receptor signaling systems. Even though the full regulatory circuitry of miR-218 has yet to be completely elucidated, our study revealed a potential negative feedback pattern in which a miRNA was co-transcribed with the Slits ligand and repressed Robo1 receptor expression. This study not only provides new insights into the metastatic mechanism of GC but also generates a set of testable hypotheses that are helpful for understanding the miRNA-mediated regulation of cellular ligand/receptor interactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in invasive GC cells compared with non-invasive GC cells. Here we have showed that when significantly downregulated, miR-218 promoted GC cell invasion and metastasis, at least in part via induction of Robo1. This result indicates that restoration of miR-218 may be a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of GC in the future. It remains to be investigated whether the other differentially expressed miRNAs found in this study also participate in GC metastasis. Importantly, our findings have implications for describing new mechanisms for miRNA-mediated regulation of receptor signaling.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>The human GC cell lines MKN28 and SGC7901 were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin sodium, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin sulfate at 37°C in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide.

<title>Isolation of invasive and non-invasive cell sublines using transwell chambers</title>
<p>Six-well polycarbonate transwell membrane inserts with 8-µm pores (Corning, USA) were used to isolate cell sublines with different levels of invasiveness from the cultured MKN28 cell line. First, cells that were serum-starved for 24 h were suspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 to a final cell density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. A 1 mL cell suspension was seeded into the top chamber, which was coated with 200 mg/mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and the lower well beneath the polycarbonate membranes was filled with 2.5 mL RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 20% bovine serum to create a chemotactic gradient to stimulate penetration of the cells. Following incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the invasive cells on the underside of the membrane and the non-invasive cells on the top of the membrane were harvested aseptically and were expanded for selection. Via ten-round selection, the cell subline that failed to invade through the membranes in all selection rounds was designated as MKN28-NM, and the subline that was able to migrate through the membranes was designated as MKN28-M. We also obtained two cell sublines, SGC7901-M and SGC7901-NM, derived from the SGC7901 GC cell line, using the same method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000879-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> migration and invasion assays</title>
<p>A 24-well transwell plate (8-µm pore size, Corning, USA) was used to measure each cell line's migratory and invasive ability. For transwell migration assays, 2.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in the top chamber lined with a non-coated membrane. For invasion assays, chamber inserts were coated with 200 mg/mL of Matrigel and dried overnight under sterile conditions. Then, 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in the top chamber. In both assays, cells were suspended in medium without serum or growth factors, and medium supplemented with serum was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the top chambers were wiped with cotton wool to remove the non-migratory or non-invasive cells. The invading cells on the underside of the membrane were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min, air-dried, stained in 0.1% crystal violet, and counted under a microscope.
