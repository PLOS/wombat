The authors present the details of calculation results of using both algorithms under different grid sizes. The authors position the manuscript as a paper comparing the dose calculation results for the prostate cancer treatment with ERB, and the authors state that the AXB with 2 mm grid size is an endeavour worth undertaking for achieving the dose calculation accuracy and speed for prostate cancer treatment. However, the authors fail to make a clear and logical comparison for the results of two algorithms on their defined treatment plan. Overall, this manuscript reads like an experiment report with plain and simple analysis. Quite less insight and conclusion are made for the why and how the algorithm selection is made, instead, the authors spend a great deal of efforts to present and data in tables and figures. Moreover, the potential contradictions for reasoning the algorithm selection process are not considered. For instance, the authors state “As a result, the AAA predicted a higher dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could consequently estimate better target coverage than AXB.”, “Therefore, the calculated TCP of AAA was relatively higher than that of AXB, and the TCP differences among the algorithms showed a quite large variations (4.05%), which were statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.01).”, and “However, the HI of AAA was less than that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when using AXB.</p><p>”, etc., these observations apparently show that AAA can have merits on some perspective that the authors introduced for evaluating its performance. So, does that mean that the better performance of AAA algorithm in these perspectives is not enough to consider applying it to this defined treatment study? If so, what is the premise of making this selection? The authors seem to need to design a well-defined evaluation structure to compare the performance of the algorithm, such as making a rank for different evaluation parameters as the authors introduced in the paper or weighting the performance of the algorithm on these parameters. The authors need to tell the potential readers what the premise of is comparing two algorithms, and why and how to make a reasonable and sound selection for them. Based on the presentation in this manuscript, however, the authors’ effort alone now is sufficient to justify publication as an article for recommending a dose calculation algorithm for the prostate cancer treatment.</p><p>By applying the two algorithms in the prostate treatment with ERB and comparing the performances of the selected algorithm from many perspectives is a good idea, will certainly be of interest to the readership of the Plos One. However, the authors fall short of their goal to provide a systematical and logical comparison of two algorithms. With substantial revisions, including attending to English grammar, a demonstration of the comparison standards, more sound algorithm selection rules, this article could be reconsidered for publication.</p><p>Some minor comments are made in the manuscript, the author may read them.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Grid size is an important parameter in treatment planning. The authors generated VMAT plans using anisotropic analytical algorithm and Acuros XB algorithm with different grid sizes, and compared the dosimetric and radiobiological parameters. The paper is manuscript is well-organized.</p><p>1. Page 4. Materials and methods. Can you provide the weight of these prostate patients? If possible, provide some information about the variations of inter-patient anatomy. Is the anatomy related with the performance of algorithms and grid sizes? Or your selected patients can be representatives for most clinical cases?</p><p>2. line 169. Why did you select AXB1 as reference plans? Why not AAA1? Do you have specific reasons?</p><p>3. Table 3. In V95%, Dmedian, Dmean, Dmin and CN, AXB3 is larger than AXB1 and AXB2.</p><p>AAA1 is mostly larger than AAA3 and AAA5, which makes sense to me, longer calculation time generate more accurate results. Can you explain why AXB has different trends along the grid size, compared with AAA? Shorter time, but more accurate results (AXB3 )?</p><p>4. It would be solid if you have dosimetric measurement or Monte Carlo calculation. Given so many plan calculation data, it is not easy to determine which one is more accurate.</p><p>5. Table 4. Too many data were listed. It would be better to present them in a more readable way, which also leads to a conclusion.</p><p>6. Table 8. Why did you compared AAA 1mm with AXB 3 mm? Why not AAA 1 mm and AXB 1mm? Please explain this.</p><p>7. Figure 2,3,4. It may confuse reader using so many colors in the subtraction image (AXB-AAA). The image resolution is not good enough. Please use a high quality figure or use two figure (without negative dose) to present AXB&gt;AAA and AXB&lt;aaa, respectively.=""&gt;</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.
