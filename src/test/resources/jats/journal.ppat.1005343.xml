<abstract>
<p>The most severe form of malaria in humans is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The invasive form of malaria parasites is termed a merozoite and it employs an array of parasite proteins that bind to the host cell to mediate invasion. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) and reticulocyte binding-like (Rh) protein families are responsible for binding to specific erythrocyte receptors for invasion and mediating signalling events that initiate active entry of the malaria parasite. Here we have addressed the role of the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins in activating merozoite invasion after receptor engagement. We show that the cytoplasmic domains of these type 1 membrane proteins are phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Depletion of PfCK2, a kinase implicated to phosphorylate these cytoplasmic tails, blocks <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> invasion of red blood cells. We identify the crucial residues within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic domain that are required for successful parasite invasion. Live cell imaging of merozoites from these transgenic mutants show they attach but do not penetrate erythrocytes implying the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail conveys signals important for the successful completion of the invasion process.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Malaria parasites must invade red blood cells to survive within the human host. Members of the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) and reticulocyte binding-like (Rh) protein families, which are present at the apical tip of merozoites as single-pass transmembrane proteins, mediate recognition of red blood cells. Although extracellular domains of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> adhesins are required for binding red blood receptors, only the cytoplasmic region is in contact with the parasite’s cellular machinery to initiate invasion. Therefore any signal that is initiated upon binding must be communicated via the cytoplasmic domain to other targets within the malaria parasites. We investigate the role of adhesin phosphorylation in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> invasion process. We show that the majority of adhesin cytoplasmic tails are phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mutational analyses provide identification of the important residues required for phosphorylation and suggest that PfCK2 may be responsible. Using a conditional knockdown line, we show that PfCK2 is essential for parasite growth and invasion. Using transgenic lines, we show that mutation of the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail results in defects in parasite invasion. This work describes the critical residues important for signaling events and implicates PfCK2 as the essential kinase involved in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> invasion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The most lethal form of malaria in humans is caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. The merozoite form of this parasite invades red blood cells beginning with initial recognition and attachment to erythrocytes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref001">1</xref>]. This interaction is dynamic and involves considerable deformation of the erythrocyte membrane as the parasite rolls across the host cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref002">2</xref>]. After initial attachment, the merozoite reorientates such that its apical prominence is closely juxtaposed with the erythrocyte surface. This allows erythrocyte-binding ligands (also known as adhesins) of the parasite to interact with specific erythrocyte receptors mediating irreversible attachment and commitment to invasion. Following engagement of adhesins to their host receptors, a tight junction is formed between parasite and the erythrocyte membrane. Active invasion proceeds through an invagination of the erythrocyte surface and the tight junction moves from the apical to posterior pole of the merozoite, powered by the parasite’s actomyosin motor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref003">3</xref>]). Contemporaneously, apical organelles in the parasite called rhoptries secrete their proteins and lipid contents to establish the nascent parasitophorous vacuole membrane that surrounds the newly invaded malaria parasite and provides the space into which the invading parasite can move [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref004">4</xref>].Once the merozoite is inside the red blood cell, the erythrocyte membrane is sealed behind it completing invasion. Remarkably, the invasion process is accomplished within a few minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> two gene families encode important proteins that function in invasion: the erythrocyte binding-like antigens (EBLs) (EBA-140/BAEBL, EBA-175, EBA-181/JESEBL, EBL-1) and reticulocyte binding-like homolog proteins (RBPs or PfRhs) (PfRh1, PfRh2a, PfRh2b, PfRh4 and PfRh5) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref006">6</xref>]). During invasion these ligands are localized at the apical tip of the merozoite and are able to bind erythrocytes. For <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, there are several major events that occur as parasite erythrocyte binding proteins engage their respective host erythrocyte receptors. Upon rupture from an infected schizont, merozoites experience a rise in cytoplasmic calcium perhaps as a response to a decrease in potassium ion concentration and exposure of parasites to the extracellular milieu of the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref008">8</xref>]. This results in the release of micronemal proteins such as EBA-175 onto the merozoite surface, which binds to glycophorin A on the erythrocyte surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref008">8</xref>]. This receptor-adhesin interaction restores cytoplasmic calcium levels and triggers the release of rhoptry contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Other studies analysing the hierarchy and coordination of the molecular steps for merozoite invasion using super-resolution microscopy and specific <italic>Pfrh</italic> and <italic>ebl</italic> gene knockouts in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> have provided a means to isolate the function of EBA-175 and PfRh4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref004">4</xref>]. These studies have shown that EBA-175 and PfRh4 play a direct role in attachment, subsequently followed by tight junction formation and rhoptry release. Also, there is evidence that the EBL and PfRh protein families mediate attachment to the erythrocyte and initiate an internal signal within the merozoite which triggers release of the rhoptry contents for establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole as the invading parasite moves into the host cell using force generated by the actin-myosin motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>How the parasite communicates a signal from its extracellular binding domain to the molecular machinery within the parasites is yet to be understood. Studies on the cytoplasmic tail of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) clearly show that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail by Protein Kinase A is essential for parasite invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref011">11</xref>]. However, mounting evidence suggests an important role for the small cytoplasmic domains (also termed tails) within EBL and PfRh proteins for the completion of the invasion process. First, removal of the cytoplasmic domain of EBA-175 results in an inability of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> to invade using the EBA-175-glycophorin A receptor-ligand interaction, although its subcellular localization and binding capabilities remain unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref012">12</xref>]. Second, PfRh2a/2b chimeric strains showed that the differential ability to use distinct PfRh2a or PfRh2b pathways is conferred by the cytoplasmic domains of PfRh2a and PfRh2b, not by their ectodomain or transmembrane regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref013">13</xref>]. More recently, phosphorylation of Ser<sup>3233</sup> of the PfRh2b cytoplasmic tail was detected in late stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites although mutation of this site did not have an effect in parasite invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref014">14</xref>].The acidic regions of the PfRh1, PfRh4 and PfRh2b cytoplasmic tails have been suggested to bind aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), two proteins known to interact with parasite actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus it has been hypothesized that these interactions may form a bridge between parasite adhesins and the actin-myosin motor. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, it should be noted that the interaction of GAPDH and aldolase with adhesin tails are not required for host cell invasion but rather for parasite metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref016">16</xref>]. Therefore, a detailed molecular study is required to determine exact residues and regions within EBL and PfRh cytoplasmic tails that are functionally required for signal transduction during parasite invasion.</p>
<p>In this work, using PfRh4 as a model adhesin, we address the role of the cytoplasmic domain in merozoite invasion. We show that several residues in the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail serve as substrates for phosphorylation and provide evidence implicating <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> Casein Kinase 2 (PfCK2). These residues in the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail are essential for erythrocyte invasion via the PfRh4-CR1 receptor-ligand interaction. This shows that specific residues within cytoplasmic domains are required for successful invasion of malaria parasites into human erythrocytes.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic domains of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> adhesins are phosphorylated by parasite kinases</title>
<p>The cytoplasmic tails of the EBLs and PfRh protein families have several potential phosphorylation sites as determined by the use of the prediction algorithm NetPhosK developed for eukaryotic kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref017">17</xref>]. Strikingly, most of these cytoplasmic tails with the exception of PfRh1 have either single or multiple predicted sites for the acidophilic kinase CK2 (residues highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine if these cytoplasmic tails could be phosphorylated, the tail domains were fused to gluthathione-S transferase (GST) and <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays were performed using <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> D10 merozoite lysate as a source of parasite kinases. All cytoplasmic tails of the EBLs and PfRh proteins were phosphorylated under these conditions with the exception of the PfRh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Control reactions using GST alone showed that the affinity tag had no sites that were recognized by parasite kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify the parasite kinase involved in phosphorylation of these cytoplasmic tails, a panel of active <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> kinases was used that included PfCK2α, PfGSK3, PfPK7, PfMap2 and PfPK6, in <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with the adhesin cytoplasmic tails. The first lane of these kinase assays contains the labelled cytoplasmic domain without any added kinases (no kinase lane, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The kinases above except for PfMap2 show robust auto-phosphorylation or phosphorylation of known substrates indicative for active kinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). PfCK2 was able to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domains of PfRh2b, PfRh4, EBA140, EBA175 and EBA181 whereas the other kinases showed significantly less levels of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Whilst we cannot rule out contributions from other kinases these results suggest that PfCK2 is a candidate kinase for phosphorylation of the EBL and PfRh cytoplasmic domains.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Site and kinase specificity for PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation</title>
<p>The cytoplasmic domain of PfRh4 was used as a model adhesin to determine the amino acid residues involved in phosphorylation. This domain has three serine and two tyrosine residues that are potential sites for kinase phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Each serine and tyrosine was mutated individually to alanine within the context of the PfRh4 tail and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays were performed with merozoite lysates as a source of kinase activity. After adjusting for protein loading of each recombinant fragment fused to GST, the <sup>32</sup>P signal of the mutants was normalized to wildtype PfRh4 tail phosphorylation signal, which was arbitrarily set to 100%. Mutation of serine 1652 to alanine (S1652A) had a negligible effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, left panel). Mutation of serine 1667 (S1667A) showed 60.0 ± 15.62% of phosphorylation relative to wildtype, however this reduction did not reach statistical significance. Mutation of serine 1674 (S1674), tyrosine 1680 (Y1680) and tyrosine 1684 (Y1684) to alanine resulted in signals at 66.6 ±14.44%, 72.94 ± 16.81% and 81.21 ± 20.11% of the wildtype cytoplasmic domain respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, left panel). As no single residue resulted in a significant or complete loss of phosphorylation when mutated to alanine, it is clear that more than one residue contributes to the full level of phosphorylation within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic domain.</p>

<p>To determine which amino acid residues were substrates for phosphorylation, cytoplasmic domains were made that contained multiple mutations of the candidate amino acid residues. Double and multiple mutants were constructed with the S1667A mutation as this mutation showed the highest reduction in phosphorylation in the single mutant analyses. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with parasite lysate, each double mutant combination had a statistically significant effect on the level of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, right panel). In addition, mutation of any putative kinase site in combination with S1667A resulted in a similar reduction in phosphorylation to that observed when either the four (All 4 lane: S1667A, S1674A, Y1680A and Y1684A) or five (All 5 lane: S1652A, S1667A, S1674A, Y1680A and Y1684A) putative kinase sites were mutated. Although the tyrosine residues did not appear to contribute to PfRh4 phosphorylation when mutated singly, mutation of both resulted in a 49.5 ± 6.5% level of phosphorylation relative to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, right panel).</p>
<p>To further demonstrate the involvement of PfCK2 in phosphorylating the cytoplasmic domain of PfRh4, the specific inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB) was tested for its effect on phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref018">18</xref>]. Using concentrations of TBB ranging from 0.625 to 10 μM, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We note however, that the specificity of TBB has not been tested in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> lysates and may inhibit other parasite kinases apart from PfCK2. In addition, we mutated all predicted PfCK2 phosphorylation sites in the other EBL and PfRh cytoplasmic tails and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with parasite lysate as a source of kinases. The following sites were mutated: EBA140 (S1159A, S1168A, T1173A), EBA175 (T1466A as mut A) and (S1489A as mut B) and in combination (mut A and B), EBA181 (S1528A, S1553A, S1557A, T1564A), PfRh2a (S3128A) and PfRh2b (S3233, residues are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In all cases the mutations resulted in a visible reduction in phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Whilst these results suggest that PfCK2 is an important kinase, it appears that other kinases and putative sites are also involved in the phosphorylation of EBA140, EBA175, EBA181 and PfRh2b tails as in most cases, phosphorylation was reduced by no greater that 50% following mutation of predicted CK2 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>The loss of PfCK2 affects parasite growth</title>
<p>To examine if the loss of PfCK2 function in parasites would result in a reduction in parasite growth, the destabilization domain (DD) system was used to regulate the amount of PfCK2 in parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref019">19</xref>].

In the presence of the ligand Shield-1, there was expression of PfCK2-HA-DD, however, upon removal of Shield-1 there was a progressive degradation of PfCK2-HA-DD over time with a maximum degradation of approximately 80% within 4 hours, which did not decrease over longer time points (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s002">S2</xref>)</p>

(B) Time course PfCK2 expression in 3D7-PfCK2DD parasites in the presence and absence of Shield-1. Shield-1 was removed at the ring stage of a synchronous parasite population, Day 0 (5% parasitemia). Absence of Shield-1 resulted in the progressive down-regulation of PfCK2. Parasite proteins were extracted using saponin lysis and analysed by western blotting for the presence of HA-tagged PfCK2 protein. HSP70 served as a loading control for normalisation.

<p>To determine if the function of PfCK2 was essential, growth assays of PfCK2-HA-DD parasites were performed in the presence and absence of Shield-1. In the presence of Shield-1, PfCK2-HA-DD parasites showed increasing parasitemia, however, in its absence, no increase in parasitemia was observed even after 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Using a shorter time course, parasite progression was followed through the later stages of the asexual life cycle by staining with the DNA stain Sybr Green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Parasite growth in the presence or absence of Shield-1 did not show any difference in the proportion of rings maturing into trophozoites and schizonts from 16 to 44 hours of the blood stage cycle. Also, from 44 to 50 hours, in the presence of Shield-1, PfCK2-HA-DD parasites were able to rupture and reinvade new erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). However in the absence of Shield-1, although there was a distinct mature parasite population, there was not a significant increase in the ring population from 44 to 50 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the decrease in PfCK2 levels caused a defect in merozoite invasion or a delay in parasite progression.</p>
<p>To examine if the decrease in PfCK2 levels would also result in a defect in parasite egress, we removed Shield-1 from trophozoite stage parasites and observed parasites every hour from 42 to 48 hours. Using light microscopy and Giemsa-stained parasite smears, we quantitated the percentage of schizont stage parasites, fully segmented parasites and newly-invaded rings. We observed that PfCK2 knockdown parasites were still able to generate rings which suggest that that late segmented parasites are still able to egress and invade fresh erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>The cytoplasmic tail of PfRh4 is required for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> merozoite invasion</title>
<p>The W2mef strain of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> is particularly reliant on EBA-175 as a key parasite invasion ligand and the gene encoding PfRh4 is silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref024">24</xref>]. However, loss of EBA175 function, either by <italic>eba175</italic> gene disruption or receptor ablation by treatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase, results in selection of W2mef parasites that express high levels of PfRh4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref023">23</xref>]. This suggests that the function of EBL and PfRh protein families are overlapping and that PfRh4 is capable of complementing the loss of EBA-175 function. To determine if the cytoplasmic domains of these adhesins are functionally equivalent a transgenic line called Rh4-175tail was constructed that substituted 67 amino acids of PfRh4 tail with 60 amino acids of EBA-175 cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Additionally, the PfRh4 tail was replaced with the cytoplasmic sequence of AMA1, generating a line called Rh4-AMA1tail. Both Rh4-175tail and Rh4-AMA1tail expressed the modified PfRh4 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">5A</xref>).</p>

Neuraminidase-treatment of erythrocytes blocks the ability of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> merozoites to use ligands that bind to sialic acid-containing receptors. PfRh4 binds to CR1 and this interaction is not affected by neuraminidase-treatment and selection of W2mef parasites results in selection for those in which the <italic>pfrh4</italic> gene has been activated and functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref027">27</xref>]. Growth of the transgenic parasites was monitored over 12 days to determine if the mutant PfRh4 proteins were functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The control lines W2mef, W2mefΔRh4 (lacks PfRh4 function), W2mefΔ175 (PfRh4 expression activated) and Rh4-WT tail (tail replaced with the WT Rh4 tail sequence) were also tested. Note that when Rh4-WT tail is integrated the activated transcription at the nearby drug cassette activates the native PfRh4 promoter, which results in transcription of Rh4-WT tail. In wildtype W2mef however, the PfRh4 promoter is not activated in the major of parasites until selection on neuraminidase-treated cells selects for the population of cells that activate transcription of PfRh4. As in previous studies, growing W2mef parasites on neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes results in the selection of a parasite population in which PfRh4 was expressed and functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). As expected the Rh4-WTtail and W2mefΔ175 parasites were capable of invading neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (86% and 79% respectively, average value from all growth cycles) because they also express fully functional PfRh4. In contrast, W2mefΔRh4 was not able to invade and grow in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (1%, average value from all growth cycles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The Rh4-EBA175tail and Rh4-AMA1tail parasites showed a dramatic reduction in their ability to grow in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (12 and 4% respectively, average value from all growth cycles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These results show that the amino acid sequence within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail was functionally important and could not be complemented by the cytoplasmic domains from a member of the EBL protein family or AMA-1.</p>

<title>Specific amino acids of the PfRh4 cytoplasmic domain are essential in its function in merozoite invasion</title>
<p>To determine if the putative phosphorylation sites within the PfRh4 tail played a role in parasite growth, transgenic lines were generated with single and multiple amino acid mutations. Initially, parasite lines that expressed mutant PfRh4 were constructed in which all four and five putative serine and tyrosine phosphosites within the cytoplasmic tail were mutated. Rh4-mut4 tails contains the mutations S1667A, S1674A, Y1680A and Y1684A, and Rh4-mut5 tail contains similar mutations with an addition mutation at S1652A within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail respectively which migrated as a slightly larger doublet compared to PfRh4 in W2mefΔ175, consistent with the addition of the hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Rh4-mut4 tail and Rh4-mut5 tail expressed PfRh4 and all showed an apical localization similar to another rhoptry protein PfRh2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The PfRh4 protein was functional in Rh4-WT tail line but not functional in any of the other mutant parasite lines, as they were not able to grow in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (~ 1%, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">5C</xref>). These results suggest that all or some of these amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of the 205 kDa PfRh4 play an essential role in merozite invasion.</p>
<p>To determine the importance of specific amino acids in the function of the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail transgenic lines were generated with single mutations at the position of the serine and tyrosine residues. Despite repeated attempts we were unable to obtain integration of the S1652A mutant. However, the other mutant lines expressed the tagged PfRh4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast to the prediction from our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, mutation of individual serine residues resulted in a very small effect on parasite growth and PfRh4 function (ranging from 81 to 71%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). However, mutation of individual tyrosine residues resulted in a 50% reduction in parasite growth in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The effect of mutating tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail became more pronounced when combined with S1667A (2–3%) or when both tyrosine residues were mutated within the tail (3.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). However, mutation of both serine residues (S1667A and S1674A) did not show a further reduction in PfRh4 function compared to S1674A alone (67 vs 71% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). These results show that S1667, Y1680 and Y1684 are key amino acids in the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail for this protein’s function in parasite growth.</p>

<title>Live imaging of the invasion defect of transgenic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> strains harbouring mutations in the PfRh4 cytoplasmic domain</title>
<p>Our growth assays indicate that transgenic parasites with mutations within their PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail lose the ability to thrive in the presence of neuraminidase-treated red blood cells. We hypothesize that this decline in growth was due to a reduction of successful invasions employing the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway. To verify this hypothesis, we performed live imaging of transgenic parasites during invasion to determine how efficiently they invaded and where the process was being blocked. Wild type merozoites contact neighbouring red blood cells and proceed through the stages of pre-invasion, internalization and echinocytosis. PfRh4 is thought to act during pre-invasion when strong deformation and reorientation of the parasite occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref028">28</xref>]. Imaging of merozoites following schizont rupture indicated that Rh4-WT tail, Rh4-mut4 tail, Rh4-AMA1 tail and Rh4-175 tail parasite lines had a mean of 1.5 to 3.5 invasions per rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Following neuraminidase-treatment of erythrocytes, which forces merozoites to utilize the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway, the number of successful invasions per rupture declined significantly in Rh4-175 tail and Rh4-mut4 tail lines and no invasions were observed in the Rh4-AMA1 tail line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant change in the mean number of invasions per rupture of PfRh4-WTtail parasites into neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes.</p>

<p>Since the number of invasions per rupture was dependent on the density of surrounding red blood cells, which may vary from rupture to rupture, we assessed the percentage of merozoite contacts with erythrocytes that lead to successful invasion for each schizont rupture. Reflective of the analysis above, nearly all lines showed a similar percentage of contacts that resulted in successful invasion, and using neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes, Rh4-mut4 tail, Rh4-AMA1 tail and Rh4-175 tail parasite lines invaded much less efficiently, while the Rh4-WT tail line had no significant decrease in contacts that led to invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Whilst the Rh4-mut4 tail merozoites appeared to exhibit more invasions per rupture and a greater percentage of contacts that invaded compared to the other lines it is likely that this is not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). It is likely that this will differ from experiment to experiment dependent on factors such as parasitaemia and hematocrit. Collectively, these results show that mutation or substitution of the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail renders merozoites incapable of using the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway and directly results in the lack of parasite proliferation in neuraminidase-treated red blood cells.</p>
<p>Since the stage of pre-invasion where PfRh4 is thought to play a role is characterized by strong deformation and reorientation, we analysed how mutation of the PfRh4 tail affected these parameters. We used our previously published four point deformation scale with zero being no deformation and three being strong deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref028">28</xref>]. Merozoites from Rh4-mut4 tail, Rh4-AMA1 tail and Rh4-175 tail parasite lines showed similar levels of deformation and invasion upon contact with untreated erythrocytes as compared to the Rh4-WT tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Following neuraminidase-treatment, however, the deformation scores were much lower for all lines, in keeping with our previously published results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Merozoites from the Rh4-mut4 tail, Rh4-AMA1 tail and Rh4-175 tail parasite lines attached and often weakly deformed the neuraminidase-treated erythrocyte surface as they moved over it but could rarely penetrate it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005343.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s003">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s004">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s005">S3</xref> Movies respectively). The Rh4-WT tail merozoites were likewise unable to strongly deform neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes but were still able to invade which stands in contrast to previous data positively correlating successful invasion with strong deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005343.s006">S4 Movie</xref>). Therefore, we show here for the first time, that PfRh4 dependent invasion does not require strong deformation, which implies that EBA proteins interacting with their cognate glycophorin receptors are primarily responsible for robust deformation. Overall these results indicate that PfRh’s and EBA’s likely have complementary functions rather than being completely redundant and that the cytoplasmic tail of PfRh4 plays an important role in triggering downstream events affecting invasion, which are not functionally substituted by the tails of other invasion ligands.</p>

<p>The EBL and PfRh family of adhesins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites mediate recognition of human erythrocytes for invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref001">1</xref>]. Upon attachment of these proteins to the erythrocyte, current evidence suggests that they also function to signal downstream events within the parasite such as rhoptry secretion and tight junction formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref014">14</xref>]. We have investigated the potential role of these adhesins to signal downstream events in invasion after initial merozoite interaction with the host cell. We have shown that specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of these adhesins, including PfRh4, are substrates for phosphorylation by parasite kinases. PfCK2 has been implicated as an important kinase for phosphorylation of these cytoplasmic domains for signalling of downstream events in merozoite invasion.</p>
<p>PfRh4 was used as a model adhesin to analyse its function in signalling and merozoite invasion as we can block the function of other members of the EBL and PfRh family by treatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref023">23</xref>]. This enabled us to test the role of the cytoplasmic tail and specific amino acids and show that they were essential for the function of PfRh4 in merozoite invasion of human erythrocytes. The mutant merozoites were able to attach to erythrocytes but they were defective in their ability to deform and invade neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. These results indicate that specific amino acids, within the cytoplasmic domains of PfRh4 maybe involved in signalling of downstream invasion events.</p>
<p>Our results have shown that the cytoplasmic domains of other <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> ligands are unable to complement the function of the equivalent region in PfRh4. This is in contrast to previous results that showed substitution of the EBA175 cytoplasmic tail with the C-terminal amino acids of TRAP, a protein involved in sporozoite invasion into liver cells, was fully functional for merozoite invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref012">12</xref>]. This has suggested that both TRAP and EBA175 cytoplasmic tails have the same function and likely bind to the same adaptor protein in invasion regardless of host cell type. It suggests that PfRh4 and EBA175 may have some distinct functions in merozoite invasion with respect to the role of the cytoplasmic domain. However, disruption of the gene encoding EBA175 in W2mef parasites results in selection of those that have activated expression of PfRh4 suggesting that it is capable of complementing this loss-of-function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref023">23</xref>]. This is consistent with other <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> lines where disruption of the <italic>eba175</italic> gene results in increased transcription of the <italic>pfrh4</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref029">29</xref>]. Whilst the cytoplasmic domains of EBA175 and PfRh4 appear to be functionally distinct it is possible that the downstream effects in the merozoite may be similar.</p>
<p>One clear difference between PfRh4 and EBA175 cytoplasmic tail may be their ability to recruit aldolase and GAPDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref015">15</xref>]. These studies were done using peptides encompassing only the C-terminal acidic domains of these cytoplasmic regions and do not include most of the putative phosphorylation sites analysed in this study. In particular, the acidic nature of these cytoplasmic domains in combination with the presence of subterminal tyrosine or phenylalanine appear necessary for aldolase binding to the PfRh1, PfRh4 and PfRh2 tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref015">15</xref>]. It has been thought that the binding of the PfRh tails to aldolase and GADPH creates a bridge with the parasite action-myosin motor that drives invasion. However, the acidic domain of EBA175 cytoplasmic domain does not recruit aldolase and this remains one of important differences with respect to PfRh4 and their individual function in parasite invasion. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, it should be noted that the interaction of GAPDH and aldolase with adhesin tails are not required for host cell invasion but rather for parasite metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>From our analyses it was clear that tyrosine residues within the PfRh4 tail play a key role in the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway and that this likely involves phosphorylation. Classical tyrosine kinases have not been identified in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and the general consensus has been that they do not exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref030">30</xref>]. However, recent analyses of global phospho-proteomes detected several tyrosine phosphorylation sites though many of these resided within the activation loop of kinases (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref031">31</xref>]. Taking in account a higher false discovery rate for phosphor-tyrosine, it has been calculated that only 0.25–0.5% of the parasite’s phospho-proteome is due to tyrosine phosphorylation. In yeast and in human cells, CK2 has been shown to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on specific substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref032">32</xref>]. The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by CK2 is S/T-X-X-D/E/pS/pY where X can be any amino acid except proline, though it must be noted that other tyrosine phosphorylation sites that have been detected that do not conform to this canonical sequence. Of note is that the tyrosine residues within PfRh4 cytoplasmic tails sit within an extremely acidic region that is conducive for CK2-mediated phosphorylation. Studies of yeast Fpr3 show that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of a tyrosine within an acidic region requires preliminary phosphorylation of a proximal serine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref034">34</xref>]. It may be the case that PfCK2 initially phosphorylates the serine residues within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail. This signal may “prime” the cytoplasmic tail for the necessary phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues when the PfRh4 engages with its receptor CR1 and thus commits the parasite to invasion. This hypothesis is consistent with the contribution of multiple amino acids to the overall level of phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Mutation of the putative phosphosites within the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail resulted in a loss of phosphorylation and also of the ability of the merozoite to invade neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. This is consistent with phosphorylation of these amino acids playing an essential role in signaling downstream event after the engagement of PfRh4 with its receptor CR1. However, in most cases, the loss of phosphorylation did not correlate with the extent to which the PfRh4 function was affected for invasion. The effect of the mutation(s) in the PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail on parasite growth is the most relevant measure of the functional importance of each residue. PfRh4 is a type I membrane protein and the proximity of the potential phosphosites to the membrane may be important in regulating signaling events during invasion and how accessible the cytoplasmic tail might be to interacting proteins. One may envision that binding of PfRh4 to CR1 transduces a signal from the extracellular binding domain to the cytoplasmic domain resulting in a change in conformation within the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This may facilitate subsequent phosphorylation of the tail, which then allows recruitment of the relevant proteins for the downstream events in invasion. The mechanism as to how the extracellular binding of the receptor CR1 initiates transfer of information to the cytoplasmic tail of PfRh4 remains to be investigated</p>
<p>It is interesting to highlight that another common post-translational modification is tyrosine O sulfation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref035">35</xref>]. In eukaryotic systems, sulfated tyrosine assist in the enhancement of protein-protein interactions. There has not been any report identifying tyrosine O sulfation of proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and genome searches suggest that this parasite lacks sulfotransferases and other enzymes required for synthesis of the necessary co-factors. Therefore it is unlikely that this potential modification of tyrosine residues occurs and is relevant.</p>
<p>Video imaging of live <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> merozoites invading human erythrocytes has provided important information on the mechanics of this process and the function of specific proteins at each step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref028">28</xref>]. Performing live imaging on lines with specific mutations in PfRh4 has provided information of the role of this protein during the different stages of invasion. In the absence of PfRh4 function the mutant merozoites are unable to invade neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes but still contact and maintain attachment to the host cell. It has been shown that engagement of EBA175 to glycophorin A results in the release of rhoptry proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005343.ref008">8</xref>]. In the case of PfRh4, perhaps its interaction with CR1 results in the activation/release of other parasite factors at the apical tip. These factors may still reside within the parasite and respond only to appropriate signaling by a functional PfRh4 cytoplasmic tail. One possibility is the release of rhoptry bulb contents such as lipids or proteins that assist in the establishment of the new parasitophorous vacuole in which the parasite resides. These lipids and proteins may have some ability to modulate the erythrocyte cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>This work has shown that the cytoplasmic tail plays an essential role in the function of PfRh4 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> merozoite invasion. Our current evidence suggests that this involves the phosphorylation of key amino acids in these domains, and that this provides a signal for subsequent downstream events for merozoite invasion. An objective for future work is to identify the adaptor proteins that may bind to the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins, especially in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and transfer the signal for activation of the invasion process. It is also of interest that the EBA175 cytoplasmic tail may recruit different parasite factors compared to PfRh4 and future work will need to address the multiple complexes that signal during this rapid phase in invasion.</p>

<title>Movie of Rh4-WT tail merozoites attempting to invade neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes.</title>
<p>They were unable to strongly deform neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes but were still able to invade which stands in contrast to previous data positively correlating successful invasion with strong deformation.</p>
