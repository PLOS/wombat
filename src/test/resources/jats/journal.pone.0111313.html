In Portugal, <em>Eucalyptus globulus</em> plantations account for one-third of the total forested area. The nutritional requirements of this crop have been well studied, and nitrogen (N) is one of the most important elements required for vegetal growth. N dynamics in soils are influenced by microorganisms, such as diazotrophic bacteria (DB) that are responsible for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), so the aim of this study was to evaluate and identity the main groups of DB in <em>E. globulus</em> plantations. Samples of soil and root systems were collected in winter and summer from three different Portuguese regions (Penafiel, Gavião and Odemira). We observed that DB communities were affected by season, N fertilization and moisture. Furthermore <em>Bradyrhizobium</em> and <em>Burkholderia</em> were the most prevalent genera in these three regions. This is the first study describing the dynamic of these bacteria in <em>E. globulus</em> plantations, and these data will likely contribute to a better understanding of the nutritional requirements of eucalypt cultivation and associated organic matter turnover.</p>

The genus <em>Eucalyptus</em> belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is comprised of a variety of species distributed throughout the world and grown under a wide variety of environmental conditions <a href="#pone.0111313-ABRAF1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>. Eucalypts are cultivated primarily for the production of cellulose, paper, boards, plywood sheets, charcoal and pharmaceuticals <a href="#pone.0111313-ABRAF1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>. It is estimated that in 2030, due to strong demand, annual lumber consumption by industries will reach 2.44 billion m<sup>3</sup>, which represents a 45% increase over consumption in 2005 <a href="#pone.0111313-FAO1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>. The rapid growth of eucalypts demands high availability of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), which is absorbed and accumulated in large quantities <a href="#pone.0111313-Smerthurst1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Gobert1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>. The productivity of eucalypt forests is directly related to the nutrient balance of the soil.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Nitrogen in the atmosphere (N<sub>2</sub>) is the primary N reservoir and can be made available through the process of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Due to their high energy costs, BNF processes are restricted to microorganisms that have the nitrogenase enzyme complex <a href="#pone.0111313-Vitousek1" class="ref-tip">[5]</a>. These N-fixing microorganisms can be free-living, associative or mutualistic <a href="#pone.0111313-Smith1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-James1" class="ref-tip">[7]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>The association of diazotrophic bacteria (DB) with different plant species has been detected using various microbiological and molecular biological techniques <a href="#pone.0111313-Rosado1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>–<a href="#pone.0111313-Wartiainen1" class="ref-tip">[10]</a>. Studies of these bacteria represent new ways of understanding the dynamics of the microbial communities involved in N cycling, especially with the use of genes that encode enzymes involved in BNF. The <em>nifH</em> gene, which encodes nitrogenase reductase, is an example of these genes <a href="#pone.0111313-Rosado1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Rosch1" class="ref-tip">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Hong1" class="ref-tip">[12]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>The nested polymerase chain reaction with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Nested-PCR-DGGE) techniques using the <em>nifH</em> gene is an efficient tool for detecting microorganisms that are directly related to N cycling. DGGE can monitor changes in the community structure in response to changes in environmental parameters <a href="#pone.0111313-Wartiainen1" class="ref-tip">[10]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Myers1" class="ref-tip">[13]</a>–<a href="#pone.0111313-Muyzer1" class="ref-tip">[16]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>Despite the commercial and economic importance of eucalypts, there are very few studies of the microbial communities in their ecosystems, and little is known of how soil microorganisms interact with and benefit eucalypt N nutrition. Furthermore, the adaptation of eucalypts to different environments could be related to their interactions with soil microorganisms, including DB, which have been found to be associated with eucalypt trees in the equatorial climate of Colombia <a href="#pone.0111313-Castellanos1" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>. Thus, our hypothesis is that there are endophytic or free-living DB associated to <em>E. globulus</em> in the studied regions, and that these can contribute to eucalypt N nutrition. The aims of this study were to evaluate the DB community's dynamics, identify the main groups of DB in <em>E. globulus</em> plantations, and the effects of season and N fertilization on these microorganisms.</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>In 2010, a cooperation protocol was established between the Institute of Forest and Paper Research (RAIZ Institute) of the Portucel Soporcel Group and FCUL (Science Faculty of the University of Lisbon) in the context of the latter's research project “The importance of cooperation in microbial genomics nitrogen use efficiency – The case of Eucalyptus” coordinated by Dr. Cristina Cruz. In general, the RAIZ pledged to cede some areas to allow field studies necessary for the development of the study, and in return, information of interest related to this project would be provided to RAIZ for its internal research “Dynamic N in forest soils”. The field work was led by the researcher and doctoral student Marliane Cassia Soares da Silva, FCUL, with the support of RAIZ's Lands and Forest Nutrition team and field technicians. Three study sites were selected and sampled over two seasons (winter and summer). Samples from the soil were taken according to the methodology of FCUL. RAIZ supplied information on existing methods to be used in the study, especially with regard to forestry and historical specificities of selected treatments within the trials.

<h3>Study site</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>This study was carried out in <em>E. globulus</em> plantations owned by the Portucel-Soporcel Group, in three regions of Portugal: Penafiel in the north, Gavião in the central and Odemira in the south region. To realisation, this study an accord of cooperation was established between the Portucel-Soporcel Group and Faculty of Science, University of Lisbon. These plantations were about 8 years old. The three regions were selected due to their distinct soil physicochemical properties, rainfall and climate (<a href="#pone-0111313-t001">Table 1</a>). In January (winter) and June 2011 (summer), samples of soil and root systems were collected from two plots within each plantation, which both had received the initial N fertilization (3.3 g N per plant) upon being planted, and only one plot from each plantation had then received N maintenance fertilization (60 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup>y<sup>−1</sup>) in the period 2004–2007. So, six plots were sampled.</p>

In samples from plots that did not receive maintenance N fertilization, pH, organic matter and ammonia content were the factors that were more related with the variation in DB communities' structure. The DB community in the root system 57.8% of the variation could be explained and was grouped according to season (<a href="#pone-0111313-g004">Figure 4F</a>). A strong relation between DB communities' structure and moisture was observed in winter samples, whereas a strong relation with pH, urease and organic matter was observed in summer samples (<a href="#pone-0111313-g004">Figure 4F</a>).</p>

<div id="section4" class="section toc-section"><a id="s4" name="s4" data-toc="s4" class="link-target" title="Discussion"></a><h2>Discussion</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>The productivity of a eucalypt forest can be affected by various biotic and abiotic factors, including soil microbial populations and their interactions with the plants. The soil microbial dynamics of these forests and in particular DB communities are relevant due to the considerable importance of eucalypts for industry, economy and the environment. DB communities may serve as a source of reactive N and plant growth promoters <a href="#pone.0111313-GamaRodrigues1" class="ref-tip">[25]</a>, including phytohormones, phosphate solubilizers and antagonists of phytopathogens <a href="#pone.0111313-Hayat1" class="ref-tip">[26]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>The differences observed in organic matter, pH, moisture, urease activity and ammonia concentrations in soils of <em>E. globulus</em> forests were primarily due to geographic localization and the typical Mediterranean climate, which is characterized by moderately cold, rainy winters and hot, dry summers (<a href="#pone-0111313-t001">Table 1</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>The low nitrification potential detected is typical of an acid soil (pH 5, <a href="#pone-0111313-t001">Table 1</a>). Plants are therefore dependent on the microorganisms that act as potential and active reservoirs of N in the soil, and control N availability via immobilization and mineralization processes <a href="#pone.0111313-GamaRodrigues1" class="ref-tip">[25]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>As observed in other regions with markedly different seasons <a href="#pone.0111313-Castellanos1" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>; <a href="#pone.0111313-Silva1" class="ref-tip">[27]</a>, no differences in the total culturable DB were observed between summer and winter (<a href="#pone-0111313-t003">Table 3</a>). However, the structure of the DB community was much influenced firstly by the season and secondly by additional N fertilization (<a href="#pone-0111313-g001">Figures 1</a>, <a href="#pone-0111313-g002">2</a> and <a href="#pone-0111313-g003">3</a>).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p5" name="article1.body1.sec4.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>PCA indicated that the influence of season on the structure of the DB community was mostly due to soil moisture. PCA was also able to differentiate between the winter and summer samples (<a href="#pone-0111313-g004">Figure 4</a>). This result makes sense because water is essential for cell metabolism in all living organisms. According to Kozdroj and Van Elsas <a href="#pone.0111313-Kozdroj1" class="ref-tip">[28]</a> and Baudoin et al. <a href="#pone.0111313-Baudoin1" class="ref-tip">[29]</a>, the profile of species in the rhizosphere or plant root system can be affected by various environmental factors, including root exudates and the availability of water and nutrients.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p6" name="article1.body1.sec4.p6" class="link-target"></a><p>Nitrogen fertilization decreased both the richness and the intensity of the DGGE bands of the DB <a href="#pone.0111313-Coelho1" class="ref-tip">[24]</a>. It is possible that N fertilization changed the DB community in our study, but the four-year interval between the last fertilization event and sample collection may have diminished the effects of fertilization.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p7" name="article1.body1.sec4.p7" class="link-target"></a><p>The band pattern observed in the DGGE gels, including the overlapping of various bands across the gel, may reflect the large number of bacterial species common to all the studied regions (<a href="#pone.0111313.s001">Table S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313.s002">S2</a> and <a href="#pone.0111313.s003">S3</a>). However, the band pattern also reflects the amplification of the most abundant species by the nested-PCR, as well as non-detection of species less abundant in the gel <a href="#pone.0111313-Wartiainen1" class="ref-tip">[10]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p8" name="article1.body1.sec4.p8" class="link-target"></a><p>We found the principal bacterial community present in the eucalyptus forests to be Proteobacteria (<a href="#pone-0111313-g005">Figure 5</a>), one of the most diverse, which comprises various classes that contain at least one species of N-fixing bacteria <a href="#pone.0111313-Raymond1" class="ref-tip">[30]</a>. Additionally, we observed bands that were at different positions in the gel but belong to the same species (<a href="#pone-0111313-g001">Figures 1</a>, <a href="#pone-0111313-g002">2</a> and <a href="#pone-0111313-g003">3</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313.s001">Table S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313.s002">S2</a> and <a href="#pone.0111313.s003">S3</a>). This may be due to the presence of multiple copies of the <em>nifH</em> gene in the genome of DB <a href="#pone.0111313-Coelho1" class="ref-tip">[24]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Zehr1" class="ref-tip">[31]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Zhan2" class="ref-tip">[32]</a>. This gene was selected as marker for DB for its presence in the vast majority of N-fixing bacteria, because it displays highly conserved regions, and since its phylogeny has shown to be consistent with the phylogeny of DB based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene <a href="#pone.0111313-Zehr1" class="ref-tip">[31]</a>. The database of the genes that encode for the nitrogenase enzyme is currently one of the largest non-ribosomal gene databases for nonculturable microorganisms <a href="#pone.0111313-Zehr1" class="ref-tip">[31]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p9" name="article1.body1.sec4.p9" class="link-target"></a><p><em>Bradyrhizobium</em> and <em>Burkholderia</em> (<a href="#pone-0111313-g006">Figure 6</a>), which were also identified in eucalypt plantations in Colombia <a href="#pone.0111313-Castellanos1" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>, were the dominant genera of DB in the studied Portuguese eucalypt forests. The genus <em>Bradyrhizobium</em> is characterized by moderate adaptation to semi-arid conditions, a propensity to colonize the roots of many non-leguminous plants and the ability to fix nitrogen under both symbiotic and non-symbiotic conditions <a href="#pone.0111313-Kahindi1" class="ref-tip">[33]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Coelho2" class="ref-tip">[34]</a>. The genus <em>Burkholderia</em> includes free-living endophytic bacteria that are able to fix nitrogen and bacteria that form symbiotic associations with leguminous plants <a href="#pone.0111313-EstradadeLosSantos1" class="ref-tip">[35]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-Silva2" class="ref-tip">[36]</a>. Furthermore, the genus <em>Burkholderia</em> is able to promote plant growth in different ways, including by solubilizing phosphate, producing siderophores and indole compounds and acting as biocontrol agents <a href="#pone.0111313-Silva2" class="ref-tip">[36]</a>, <a href="#pone.0111313-CastroGonzlez1" class="ref-tip">[37]</a>.</p>

The most abundant groups of DB were affiliated to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria, the main genera being <em>Burkholderia</em> and <em>Bradyrhizobium</em>. This is the first study of these bacteria in Portuguese eucalypt plantations, and its results contribute to understanding of the specific requirements for the cultivation of these plants.</p>
