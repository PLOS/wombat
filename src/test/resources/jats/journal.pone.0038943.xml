        <p>Existing technologies allow isolating antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from B cells. We devised a direct approach to isolate mAbs with predetermined conformational epitope specificity, using epitope mimetics (mimotopes) that reflect the three-dimensional structure of given antigen subdomains. We performed differential biopanning using bacteriophages encoding random peptide libraries and polyclonal antibodies (Abs) that had been affinity-purified with either native or denatured antigen. This strategy yielded conformational mimotopes. We then generated mimotope-fluorescent protein fusions, which were used as baits to isolate single memory B cells from rhesus monkeys (RMs). To amplify RM immunoglobulin variable regions, we developed RM-specific PCR primers and generated chimeric simian-human mAbs with predicted epitope specificity. We established proof-of-concept of our strategy by isolating mAbs targeting the conformational V3 loop crown of HIV Env; the new mAbs cross-neutralized viruses of different clades. The novel technology allows isolating mAbs from RMs or other hosts given experimental immunogens or infectious agents.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Isolation of naturally induced and matured antibodies (Abs) is of prime importance for analytical vaccinology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Zielinski1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Corti1">[2]</xref>. Three major strategies have been used to interrogate the B-cell repertoire: traditional phage display, high-throughput screening of immortalized B cell or plasma cell cultures, and isolation of antigen-specific B cells to PCR amplify the variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) and variable light (V<sub>L</sub>) immunoglobulin (Ig) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Corti1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Kwong1">[3]</xref>. Development and refinement of high-throughput screening methods, flow cytometric capabilities and single-cell cloning techniques led to substitution of the traditional phage display techniques by approaches that allow the isolation of naturally selected Igs. Phage display is constrained by the diversity of the library used, by physical-chemical properties of the Ig fragments displayed and involves random combination of V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> pairs. Consequently, it is not known whether Abs isolated by phage display represent natural molecules generated by the host in response to immunization or infection by a pathogen of interest. Even the recently published technique based upon high-throughput DNA sequencing of the plasma cell Ig repertoire with subsequent comprehensive analysis of V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> representation resulting in the assembly of V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> pairs left the possibility that the recovered pair may be artificial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Reddy1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Naturally occurring Abs can be isolated via high-throughput screening of immortalized memory B or plasma cell cultures. This approach yielded broad and potent neutralizing monoclonal Abs (nmAbs) against HIV, dengue and influenza viruses that significantly improved our understanding of the specificity and mechanisms of humoral immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Robinson1">[5]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Beltramello1">[8]</xref>. Isolation of antigen-specific B cells by sorting with a fluorescence-activated flow cytometer (FACSorting), first reported in 1972 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Julius1">[9]</xref>, has led to the recovery of a number of naturally induced and matured Abs against rotavirus and HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Weitkamp1">[10]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Wu1">[12]</xref>. However, using the whole antigen for B-cell sorting implies a need for extensive screening of newly isolated mAbs, followed by epitope mapping. A more sophisticated approach consists of directly isolating B cells specific for individual epitopes. The success of this approach depends on the identification of epitope mimetics (mimotopes) that correctly reflect the three-dimensional structure of a given antigen subdomain/epitope. Here we report the development of a novel methodology using fluorescently labeled mimotopes as baits to isolate rhesus monkey (RM) memory B cells for subsequent cloning of Ab genes.</p>

        <title>Overview of Strategy</title>
        <p>The overall strategy is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Mimotopes were isolated by biopanning using recombinant bacteriophages encoding random peptide libraries. To enrich for conformational mimotopes, we devised a new strategy of differential biopanning that involved positive selection with Abs pre-purified on native antigen followed by negative selection with Abs eluted from denatured antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>). After a total of three rounds of positive/negative selections with these Ab preparations, the resulting mimotopes are expected to show preferential conformation dependence. Next, mimotope sequences are cloned into a vector encoding a fluorescent reporter gene, giving rise to a fluorescent fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The latter is used for mimotope-specific isolation of single memory B cells by flow cytometry. Single-cell RT-PCR is then used to amplify the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> Ig genes using newly designed, RM-specific primers. Next, the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> sequences are cloned into expression vectors encoding the backbone of human IgG1 heavy or light chains, respectively. Cotransfection into eukaryotic cells grown in serum-free medium, will yield recombinant, chimeric simian-human monoclonal Abs (mAbs). Such mAbs will specifically recognize not only the fluorescently labeled mimotope fusion protein used for the selection procedure, but also the corresponding antigen, with the epitope specificity determined by the nature of the mimotope used for the selection.</p>

            <p>After differential biopanning of phage display peptide library, mimotopes representing conformational epitopes are sequenced, and the inserts plus M13 flanking sequences are cloned into a bacterial expression vector encoding fluorescent protein. After purification of the resulting mimotope fusion proteins, binding assays to assure maintenance of the correct three-dimensional structure of mimotope insert are conducted. This is followed by single-cell sorting for specific IgG-positive memory B cells, single-cell RT-PCR and cloning of RM V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> regions into pFUSE2-type vectors encoding the backbone of human IgG1.</p>

        <title>Isolation of Conformational Mimotopes</title>
        <p>To validate our new strategy, we sought to isolate mAbs specific for the V3 loop of the HIV envelope glycoprotein, using conformation-dependent mimotopes. The V3 loop is a prime target for nAbs and has conserved structural features in the crown, although the entire loop structure is known for its remarkable sequence variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Jiang1">[13]</xref>.

        <p>We used RMs that had developed high-titer, broadly neutralizing Abs (nAbs) during chronic infection with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s007">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s008">Table S2</xref>) for B-cell isolation. First, we affinity-purified polyclonal Abs that contained paratopes specific for conformational epitopes on the original antigen molecule. In parallel, we also affinity-purified polyclonal Abs recognizing the same antigen in denatured form. Towards this end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>), wells of 96-well plates were coated with HIV gp160 under native or denaturing conditions and incubated with serum of monkey RKl-8. Bound Abs were eluted by pH shift, identical fractions were combined, concentrated and used for biopanning of random peptide phage libraries. ‚ÄúConformational‚Äù Abs (eluted from native, multimeric gp160, shown in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were used for positive selection; ‚Äúlinear‚Äù Abs (eluted from denatured gp160, shown in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>) for negative selection. Three positive/two negative rounds yielded mimotopes that were tested for gp160 specificity and conformational dependence with RM sera. Interestingly, only 12 mimotopes resembling the V3 loop crown of HIV gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) were selected using this method of differential biopanning with Abs specific for either native or denatured gp160. Some of these conformational V3 mimotopes were chosen to test the feasibility of our overall strategy. Notably, our differential biopanning strategy resulted in the selection of mimotopes with strong conformational dependence as shown by ELISA performed with native or denatured phages and probed with serum from RM RKl-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The fact that only V3-like mimotopes were found may be ascribed to the stringent selection conditions. It should be noted that mimotopes positively selected by the ‚Äúconformational‚Äù Abs (shown in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>) are discarded in the subsequent negative selection step if they are also bound to ‚Äúlinear‚Äù Abs (shown in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As a consequence, the only mimotopes that remain are those with high specificity and selective binding to the ‚Äúconformational‚Äù Abs, a condition fulfilled by the sterically constrained V3 loop.</p>

        <p>To confirm the expected V3 loop epitope specificity of mAbs 33B2 and 33C6, peptides representing the V3 loop of consensus HIV clade C gp120 were used for epitope mapping. Peptide binding analysis revealed a common epitope recognized by both mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s004">Figure S4A</xref>): the sequence RKSIRIG, which is located in the V3 loop crown and resembles the epitope of the known anti-V3 mAb, HGN194 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Corti2">[16]</xref>. Interestingly, mAb 33B2 interacted only with peptides 9259 and 9261 bearing the epitope either at the N- or C-termini but did not bind to peptide 9260, where the epitope is in the middle, presumably due to improper conformation of the linear peptide. Peptide 9261 showed the highest degree of inhibition of mAbs binding to gp120 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>). Lower binding of mAb 33B2 compared to binding of 33C6 to linear peptides 9260 and 9261 implies that epitope of 33B2 is more conformation-dependent.</p>
        <p>Since the mimotope used as B-cell bait was selected to be strongly conformational, we postulated that 33B2 and 33C6 would preferentially bind to native as opposed to denatured envelope proteins. To confirm binding to native Env in trimeric form, we performed a virion binding assay, in which both mAbs successfully captured virions of the chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) encoding <italic>env</italic> of a recently transmitted HIV clade C, SHIV-1157ipEL-p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Siddappa1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Upon Env denaturation, binding of both mAbs was strongly diminished by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g005">Figure 5D</xref>); denaturation greatly abrogated binding of both mAbs to gp120, whereas reduction of disulfide bridges did not affect binding.</p>
        <p>Next, we assessed potency/breadth of virus neutralization of the two mAbs with a panel of neutralization-sensitive (tier 1) and more difficult-to-neutralize (tier 2) viruses. Overall, 33B2 and 33C6 neutralized 75% or 91% of the tier 1 HIV strains of different clades tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038943-t001">Table 1</xref>), respectively. In contrast, few of the tier 2 strains tested were neutralized by the two new mAbs (7% and 15%, respectively). These results are similar to the neutralization profiles of other anti-V3 Abs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Gorny2">[15]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Hioe1">[17]</xref>.

        <title>Genetic Analysis of mAbs</title>
        <p>Genetic analysis of 33B2 and 33C6 V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> genes revealed that these mAbs likely originated from the same parental B cell clone, because they share the same V<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub> genes, IGHV5-51*01 and IGHJ4*2, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038943-t002">Table 2</xref>). Although 33B2 and 33C6 used different D genes, the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of both mAbs are 16 amino acids long and have very similar amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, the light chains recruited different genes, IGLV1-50 and IGLV1-47, from the same subfamily (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038943-t002">Table 2</xref>). The CDR sequence homology indicates convergence of the molecular evolution of both mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our results are in good agreement with data about Ig gene usage by other anti-V3 Abs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Gorny1">[14]</xref>. Compared to the RM germline, the frequency of amino acid mutations observed in VH was 15% for mAb 33B2 and 18% for 33C6, whereas for VL, the mutation frequencies were 10% and 15%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038943.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These values are significantly lower compared to the recently identified anti-CD4 binding site neutralizing mAbs, but comparable to the parameters of other anti-V3 mAbs and of mAb b12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Scheid1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Wu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Corti2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Parren1">[20]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Zhang1">[23]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our data give proof-of-concept that the novel mAb isolation strategy, together with the newly developed set of primers specific to RM Ig genes, yielded mAbs with the epitope specificity as predicted by the fluorescently labeled mimotope. Our methodology represents a direct approach to isolate naturally occurring, matured Abs as mAbs without the need of extensive screening and provides a practical tool for analytical vaccinology. In contrast to other methods of mAb generation using phage display with Ig fragments that yield randomly recombined Ig chains, isolating single memory B cells will allow probing of natural Ab repertoires. Our focus on isolating peripheral blood memory B cells as preferred source of matured V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> genes has an advantage compared to plasma cells. The latter lack B-cell receptors (BCR), whereas memory B cells bear antigen receptors recognizing only one epitope; these receptors serve as targets that are specifically recognized by fluorescently labeled mimotopes.</p>
      <p>An important aspect of our new technology is the use of conformational mimotopes, which we selected with affinity-purified polyclonal RM Abs specific for either native or denatured antigen. We used the power of differential biopanning to select mimotopes representing conformational epitopes and thus increased the chances of isolating biologically relevant V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> genes, since most Ab paratopes are directed against conformational targets on the antigen.</p>
      <p>Our new approach to isolate conformation-specific mAbs with predetermined epitope specificity is applicable to any antigen. General strategies depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038943-g002">2</xref> are not restricted to isolating HIV envelope-related mAbs. We chose a V3 mimotope to illustrate the power and practicality of our new approach. By opting to isolate mAbs with a narrow, well defined epitope specificity, we expect to observe far fewer ‚Äúhits‚Äù when isolating memory B cells compared to standard technologies using entire antigens as baits. The benefits of our targeted approach will be that the epitope specificity will be known, thereby obviating a labor-intensive mapping effort. Another approach to zero in on a specific antigen region involved an HIV gp120 that had been redesigned to diminish undesirable antigenic determinants to facilitate the isolation of B cells specific for the CD4-binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0038943-Wu1">[12]</xref>. The latter is known to encompass a number of different epitopes. This approach required resolving of spatial structure of the antigen as well as sophisticated protein modeling. In contrast, empirical selection of epitope mimetics by differential biopanning of phage display peptide libraries using polyclonal Abs provides a fast and easy technique to generate mimotopes resembling conformational epitopes from infected or immunized hosts.</p>
      <p>It should be pointed out that our single cell-based mAb isolation does not depend on using mimotopes with stringent conformation dependence as baits. In fact, we have performed a number of RM B-cell isolations with mimotopes that had some but not exclusive conformation dependence (unpublished data). In fact, we have performed biopannings with more than 20 RM sera from vaccinated and/or SHIV-infected animals using standard rather than differential biopanning. In such cases, we are generally able to assign the resulting mimotopes to the corresponding entire antigen of interest in approximately 90% of the cases based upon partial amino acid similarity. However, in exceptional cases, as many as 40% to 50% of the mimotopes could not be assigned and are likely representing quaternary conformational regions.</p>
      <p>Our choice of RMs as source for V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> genes will potentially yield mAbs with clinical applicability as prophylactic or therapeutic agents. Of note, RMs and humans have a closely related repertoire of Ig genes, much more so than mice, rabbits or other species used routinely for mAb isolation. Our findings of V<sub>H</sub> gene usage, length of CDR3 and frequency of mutations are similar to anti-V3 Abs derived from HIV-infected individuals, thus confirming this notion.</p>
      <p>Although we demonstrated the ability to generate mAbs with predetermined epitope specificity using the RM model of immunodeficiency virus infection, our approach can be readily extended to any target of choice, such as experimental or natural infection with potential pathogens, autoimmune diseases and cancer.</p>

The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Emory University (IACUC ID: YER-2001401-111814; Emory University Animal Welfare Assurance Number A3180-01). The rhesus monkeys were housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC, Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The animals were housed indoors with a 12 hour light/dark cycle, in individual cages but in visual and auditory contact with other RMs, were fed monkey chow (Purina) ad libitum supplemented daily with fresh fruit. Standard enrichment was provided by the YNPRC enrichment staff including perches, rubber toys and varied treats such as peanuts and cereals. Blood was collected under ketamine or Telazol anesthesia from the femoral vein. YNPRC facilities are fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Emory and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute via a Collaborating Institution Animal Use Agreement. Because the experiments described here involved a virus that may cause an incurable disease, such as AIDS, discomfort, stress and pain may occur. Animals were closely monitored and observed for development of disease at least twice daily. Animals determined to be under stress or in discomfort, were administered appropriate anesthetics and/or analgesics as directed by the clinical veterinary staff. If stress cannot be alleviated, the animals are euthanized.</p>

          <p><bold>Cloning of mimotopes into the mWasabi backbone.</bold> mWasabi and mimotope fragments were amplified using specific primers to introduce appropriate restriction sites to insert both sequences (boxed) into the pET-22b(+) vector. mWasabi was cloned first and the resulting vector pET-mWasabi.II served as an acceptor of different mimotopes. After transformation of <italic>E.coli</italic> with the resulting plasmids, mWasabi-mimotope fusion proteins were expressed under IPTG induction and purified from bacterial cell lysates by metal-affinity chromatography. pNCS-mWasabi was obtained from Allele Biotech.</p>
