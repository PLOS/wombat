<h1>Editorial Board</h1>

<p>The <em>PLOS ONE</em> Editorial Board is powered by more than 6,000 academic experts. Our board comprises working
  scientists who are established principal investigators/group leaders with extensive publication records.</p>

<p>Academic Editors oversee the peer review process for the journal, including evaluating submissions, selecting
  reviewers and assessing their comments, and making editorial decisions. Together with fellow Editorial Board Members
  and internal staff, Academic Editors uphold journal policies and ethics standards and work to promote the <em>PLOS
    ONE</em> mission to provide free public access to scientific research.</p>
<p>
  Editorial board members affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are serving in a personal capacity. The views expressed are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the United States Government.
