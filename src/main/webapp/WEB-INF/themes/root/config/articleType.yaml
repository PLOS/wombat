# The list of article types that are supported with metadata for a theme.
#
# Note that this file is a singleton map with the key "types". Child themes must override the entire "types" list at a
# time, because its order is significant.
#
# This configuration currently controls two features. The first feature is the displayed type at the top of an article
# (where child themes may provide a tooltip with a description blurb). The second feature is the list of articles on
# the "browse issue" page, which is grouped by article type. The "browse issue" page shows article types in a curated
# order, which is specified by the order of the types in this list.
#
# Each entry in the list may contain four fields:
#
#   * "name": This field is required, and must be unique for each entry. It is matched exactly to the article type
#     field given in an article's XML manuscript, and will be used as the human-readable label for the article type.
#
#   * "plural": The plural form of the article type. It will be used for a section heading on the "browse issue" page
#     if the section has more than one article. If no plural form is provided, the name will be reused.
#
#   * "code": If a child themes has a site content page that provides additional commentary on article types, the child
#     theme may optionally use this to link to anchors within that page.
#
#   * "description": An optional paragraph of text that may be associated with the article type header.
#
# An example of a complete entry follows:
#
#   - name:   "Essay"
#     plural: "Essays"
#     code:   "essay"
#     description: >
#       Essays articulate a specific perspective on
#       a topic of broad interest to scientists.
