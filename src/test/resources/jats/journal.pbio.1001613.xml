<p>Death of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> involves a conserved necrotic cell death cascade which generates endogenous blue anthranilate fluorescence, allowing death to be visualized.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>For cells the passage from life to death can involve a regulated, programmed transition. In contrast to cell death, the mechanisms of systemic collapse underlying organismal death remain poorly understood. Here we present evidence of a cascade of cell death involving the calpain-cathepsin necrosis pathway that can drive organismal death in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We report that organismal death is accompanied by a burst of intense blue fluorescence, generated within intestinal cells by the necrotic cell death pathway. Such death fluorescence marks an anterior to posterior wave of intestinal cell death that is accompanied by cytosolic acidosis. This wave is propagated via the innexin INX-16, likely by calcium influx. Notably, inhibition of systemic necrosis can delay stress-induced death. We also identify the source of the blue fluorescence, initially present in intestinal lysosome-related organelles (gut granules), as anthranilic acid glucosyl esters—not, as previously surmised, the damage product lipofuscin. Anthranilic acid is derived from tryptophan by action of the kynurenine pathway. These findings reveal a central mechanism of organismal death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that is related to necrotic propagation in mammals—e.g., in excitotoxicity and ischemia-induced neurodegeneration. Endogenous anthranilate fluorescence renders visible the spatio-temporal dynamics of <italic>C. elegans</italic> organismal death.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, intestinal lysosome-related organelles (or “gut granules”) contain a bright blue fluorescent substance of unknown identity. This has similar spectral properties to lipofuscin, a product of oxidative damage known to accumulate with age in postmitotic mammalian cells. Blue fluorescence seems to increase in aging worm populations, and lipofuscin has been proposed to be the source. To analyze this further, we measure fluorescence levels after exposure to oxidative stress and during aging in individually tracked worms. Surprisingly, neither of these conditions increases fluorescence levels; instead blue fluorescence increases in a striking and rapid burst at death. Such <italic>death fluorescence</italic> (DF) also appears in young worms when killed, irrespective of age or cause of death. We chemically identify DF as anthranilic acid glucosyl esters derived from tryptophan, and not lipofuscin. In addition, we show that DF generation in the intestine is dependent upon the necrotic cell death cascade, previously characterized as a driver of neurodegeneration. We find that necrosis spreads in a rapid wave along the intestine by calcium influx via innexin ion channels, accompanied by cytosolic acidosis. Inhibition of necrosis pathway components can delay stress-induced death, supporting its role as a driver of organismal death. This necrotic cascade provides a model system to study neurodegeneration and organismal death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While mechanisms of cell death such as apoptosis are well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Kerr1">[1]</xref>, less is known about the mechanisms of organismal death, particularly in invertebrate model organisms. Here we investigate organismal death in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, using a newly discovered, endogenous fluorescent marker of death.</p>
<p>One possibility is that organismal death results from a cascade of cell death. As first defined by Kerr et al. in 1972 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Kerr1">[1]</xref>, cell death has been viewed as taking two forms: controlled (apoptotic) or uncontrolled (necrotic). However, more recent elucidation of the mechanisms underlying necrotic cell death reveals that it too can be a regulated process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Golstein1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Zong1">[5]</xref>. Biochemical hallmarks of necrosis include calcium-mediated initiation, lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), and activation of noncaspase proteases (calpains and cathepsins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Zong1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Mattson1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Necrosis as a regulated process has been characterized mainly in mammalian neuronal models. Excitotoxic neuronal cell death occurs in response to overstimulation with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (e.g., under conditions of ischemia or stroke) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Mattson1">[7]</xref>. Sustained activation of glutamate receptors causes a cytosolic influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Mattson2">[8]</xref>. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels lead to cell death, largely through activation of associated proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Sattler1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> may spread between cells via connecting gap junctions, and gap junction inhibition reduces ischemia-induced neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Wang1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Wang2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Through the study of ischemia-induced death in mammalian CA1 hippocampal neurons, Yamashima and co-workers identified the calpain-cathepsin cascade as an effector of necrotic cell death. Ischemia increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cysteine proteases (calpains) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Yamashima1">[12]</xref>. These calpains cause lysosomal lysis, leading to cytosolic acidosis and the destructive release of lysosomal cathepsin proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Yamashima2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Many components of the calpain-cathepsin cascade are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where necrotic cell death can be induced in neurons by mutations such as <italic>mec-4(u231)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Driscoll1">[14]</xref>. For example, <italic>mec-4</italic>-induced neurodegeneration requires the calcium-dependent calpains TRA-3 and CLP-1 and the cathepsins ASP-3 and ASP-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Syntichaki1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>LMP is a central event in the necrotic cascade, and the degree of LMP can influence the cellular decision to live or to die via necrosis or apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Luke1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Zong1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Kreuzaler1">[16]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lysosomes are required for osmotic stress-induced necrotic death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Luke2">[17]</xref> and interventions that increase lysosomal pH can ameliorate <italic>mec-4(d)</italic>-induced neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Syntichaki2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells contain both lysosomes and gut granules, which are large, melanosome-like lysosome-related organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Hermann1">[19]</xref>. Under ultraviolet light, gut granules emit blue fluorescence, with maximal intensity at λ<sub>ex</sub>/λ<sub>em</sub> 340/430 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Gerstbrein1">[20]</xref>. This fluorescence has been attributed to lipofuscin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Davis1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Klass1">[22]</xref>, a heterogeneous, cross-linked aggregate of oxidatively damaged lipids and proteins. Lipofuscin accumulates with age in postmitotic mammalian cells and so has frequently been used as a biomarker of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Brunk1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Terman1">[25]</xref>. Lipofuscin composition is highly variable but can be identified by virtue of its autofluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Jung1">[24]</xref>. If excited by UV light <italic>in vitro</italic> it emits blue fluorescence, which may reflect formation of fluorescent Schiff bases between carbonyl and amino groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Chio1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Fletcher1">[27]</xref>. However, UV excitation of lipofuscin <italic>in vivo</italic> results in peak fluorescence in the 540–640 nm (orange-yellow) range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Eldred1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<p>Several observations have led to the suggestion that the fluorescent material in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine is lipofuscin. Its fluorescence peak at λ<sub>ex</sub>/λ<sub>em</sub> 340/430 nm is similar to that of lipofuscin <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is localized to the lysosome-like gut granules, and its levels increase in aging populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Gerstbrein1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Klass1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Garigan1">[29]</xref>. It is often used as a biomarker of aging—for example, to verify that treatments that shorten worm lifespan do so by accelerating aging. The presence of lipofuscin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> would support the view that aging is caused by accumulation of molecular damage. Yet it remains possible that the fluorescent substance in gut granules is not lipofuscin. For example, studies of <italic>flu</italic> mutations causing altered gut granule fluorescence suggest that it corresponds to fluorescent tryptophan metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Babu1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we describe how a reassessment of blue fluorescence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> led to the discovery of the phenomenon of death fluorescence (DF), a burst of blue fluorescence that accompanies death in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We establish that both DF and gut granule fluorescence originate not from lipofuscin, but from tryptophan-derived anthranilic acid glucosyl esters. We then show that DF is generated by the calpain-cathepsin necrotic cell death pathway, and requires calcium signaling for organismal propagation. Finally, we show that inhibition of this pathway can protect animals against stress-induced death, supporting a role of systemic necrotic cell death in organismal death.</p>

<title>Oxidative and Thermal Stress Do Not Increase Blue Fluorescence</title>
<p>Lipofuscin is formed through accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Jung1">[24]</xref>. For example, raised oxygen level (40% O<sub>2</sub>) increases lipofuscin levels in human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Terman1">[25]</xref>. To probe whether the blue fluorescent material in <italic>C. elegans</italic> gut granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>) is lipofuscin, we exposed them to normobaric hyperoxia (90% O<sub>2</sub>), and elevated iron levels. Both treatments significantly increased protein oxidative damage but neither increased blue fluorescence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g001">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Elevated expression of <italic>hsp-4::gfp</italic> is indicative of the unfolded protein response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Calfon1">[31]</xref>, symptomatic of protein damage. Heat shock increased <italic>hsp-4::gfp</italic> expression but not blue fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results imply that <italic>C. elegans</italic> blue fluorescence is not generated by oxidative damage, suggesting that it is not lipofuscin.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>A Burst of Blue Fluorescence Occurs When <italic>C. elegans</italic> Die</title>
<p>Like lipofuscin in mammals, mean fluorescence levels rise gradually with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic> population cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Gerstbrein1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Garigan1">[29]</xref>. However, population mean data do not address heterogeneity in the fluorescence of individual worms. This concern was raised by a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Gerstbrein1">[20]</xref>, as follows. Aging worms can be classed according to their degree of motility: class A animals move normally, class B animals move more slowly, and class C animals do not move away when touched, and are near to death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Herndon1">[32]</xref>. Notably, blue fluorescence levels did not differ significantly between class A and B, and only increased in class C worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Gerstbrein1">[20]</xref>. This suggests that blue fluorescence levels in worms increase only as they approach death.</p>
<p>To test this directly, fluorescence levels of individually cultured, wild-type <italic>C. elegans in situ</italic> on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates were examined at intervals throughout life (DAPI filter; λ<sub>ex</sub>/λ<sub>em</sub> 350/460 nm). As animals approached death (as indicated by reduced movement), time-lapse imaging was used to capture fluorescence changes during death. This revealed that fluorescence levels in individual animals change little until immediately prior to death. A striking and sudden ∼400% increase in fluorescence level then occurs, coinciding with cessation of movement (i.e., death) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s023">Video S1</xref>). This rise begins at ∼2 h prior to death, and then fades by ∼6 h after death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g002">Figure 2B–C</xref>).</p>

L4 larvae and adult males show smaller increases in DF than adult hermaphrodites, perhaps due to their smaller size. (B) Typical fluorescence increase in young adult worm killed by a hot pick. (C) Fluorescence increases in an anterior to posterior wave. Figure shows mean fluorescence intensity (values normalized to highest value in each individual) at 5 points along the intestine of animals dying of old age (<italic>N</italic> = 29). Due to individual variation (range, 1 h 55 min–5 h 30 min, mean ∼3 h), the duration of each observation was divided into 5 equal points for measurement. T = 0 is the point at which time-lapse photography of dying (late stage C) worms was initiated. (D) DF will not propagate in a posterior to anterior wave.

<p>Next we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of DF in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as a potential marker of cellular and organismal death. DF typically originates in the anterior-most cells of the intestine (the int1 cells). It then spreads rapidly along the intestine in an anterior to posterior wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g003">Figures 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s003">S3</xref>). In adults a second focus of fluorescence sometimes appears in the mid-body (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s003">Figure S3</xref>). When a hot pick was applied to the animals' tails (rather than near the head), DF initially only arose locally and did not spread from posterior to anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) but only, eventually, from anterior to posterior (unpublished data). This suggests that the anterior intestine represents an organismal weak point in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where a local crisis in homeostasis can trigger a DF wave.</p>

<p>To verify the identity of the blue fluorophore, we next used a genetic approach. The first step in the conversion of Trp to AA is catalyzed by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene <italic>tdo-2</italic> (C28H8.11) encodes a putative TDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Rongvaux1">[36]</xref>. <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) suppressed both gut granule blue fluorescence and DF (freeze-thaw) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g004">Figure 4C–D</xref>).

Both <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) and mutation of <italic>flu-2</italic> greatly reduce AA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-vanderGoot1">[37]</xref>. We also tested whether exogenous AA is sufficient to cause blue gut granule fluorescence. <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) worms were incubated in a range of solutions of synthetic anthranilic acid (Sigma). Incubation with 5 mM AA restored gut granule fluorescence to a wild-type level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s010">Figure S10A–B</xref>). We conclude that gut granule fluorescence and DF emanate from AA.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>DF Does Not Require Increased Fluorophore Concentration</title>
<p>Why do fluorescence levels increase at death? One possibility is that AA levels increase at the point of death. To test this we compared DF in <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) worms with restored gut granule fluorescence and in L4440-treated control worms. Interestingly, the magnitude of DF was not reduced in the <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) worms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s010">Figure S10C–D</xref>). This strongly implies that the DF burst is not the result of increased AA levels.</p>
<p>An alternative possibility is that concentration of AA within gut granules results in quenching of fluorescence. To probe this idea we employed the dye uranin, whose green fluorescence is partially quenched at low pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Sjoback1">[39]</xref>. Treatment of wild-type worms with uranin led to punctate green fluorescence in the intestine that co-localized with blue gut granule fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s011">Figure S11A</xref>). Thus, uranin accumulates within gut granules. Killing after uranin treatment caused a burst of green fluorescence in wild-type worms, but not <italic>glo-1(zu437)</italic> mutants without gut granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s011">Figure S11B–C</xref>). This supports the view that the burst of fluorescence at death is caused by dequenching of AA and uranin fluorescence due to increased pH upon release from the acidic milieu of the gut granules. It also shows that uranin is an excellent marker for loss of integrity of membranes bounding acidic compartments (e.g., lysosomes and lysosome-like organelles).</p>

<title>DF Is Generated by Necrotic Cell Death</title>
<p>The presence of blue fluorescence within lysosome-related organelles (i.e., gut granules) and the central role of LMP in multiple instances of necrotic cell death suggested that DF might be generated by necrosis. If correct, then inhibition of necrosis might be expected to suppress DF. To test this we used freeze-thaw induced death, which is convenient for rapid and accurate quantitation of DF.

Upon killing (with <italic>t</italic>-BOOH), pH in the intestinal cytosol dropped from ∼pH 7.4 to 6.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s028">Video S6</xref>) and, again, cytosolic acidosis occurred first in the anterior intestine before spreading to the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g006">Figures 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s013">S13C–D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we used uranin (green) and the lysosomotropic dye lysotracker (red) to examine gut granule membrane integrity during organismal death. Killing (with <italic>t</italic>-BOOH) resulted in a burst of uranin fluorescence, and a loss of punctate green and red fluorescence that coincided with DF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These changes were inhibited by <italic>inx-16(ox144)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s014">Figure S14</xref>). The punctate red staining took slightly longer to decay than the green, likely reflecting residual staining of lysosomal membranes with lysotracker but not uranin. Thus, both cytosolic acidosis and LMP occur in intestinal cells at death. This provides further evidence that DF is generated by necrotic cell death.</p>

<title>Stress resistance of necrosis mutants suggest model for organismal death.</title>
<p>(A) Wave of blue fluorescence is accompanied by loss of lysosomal membrane integrity upon killing with <italic>t</italic>-BOOH. The quenching of uranin fluorescence at low pH makes it an excellent marker for loss of membrane integrity in lysosome-related organelles. (B) Working model of DF and systemic necrosis during organismal death in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Unidentified factors (possibly calcium influx) trigger an initial necrotic event, typically in the anterior intestinal cells. This necrotic event includes cytosolic acidosis and LMP, which is associated with a burst of blue fluorescence from anthranilic acid glucosyl esters, which render visible the occurrence of necrosis. Necrosis in the anterior cell leads to calcium influx into the neighboring cells via INX-16 channels, triggering further necrotic events, and a cascade of necrosis along the intestine. In stress-induced death, but not aging-induced death, systemic necrosis can detectably hasten organismal death. However, it also seems likely that necrotic destruction of the intestine, a major organ within <italic>C. elegans</italic>, contributes to organismal death in senescent nematodes.</p>

<title>Attenuation of Necrosis Protects Against Stress-Induced Death</title>
<p>If systemic necrosis contributes to organismal death, then its inhibition should prevent death. To test this we examined the effect of inhibiting necrosis on death induced by aging or stress. In most cases, inhibiting necrosis did not prevent death due to aging: necrosis mutants were either normal lived or short lived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s015">Figure S15</xref>). The exception was <italic>inx-16</italic>, which was long lived; however, the slow growth and starved appearance of this strain suggests that its longevity may be caused by dietary restriction.</p>
<p>By contrast, inhibition of each point in the necrosis pathway (calcium release, calpains, lysosomal acidification, cathepsins, and innexins) was able to delay death induced by lethal osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), although not all mutants showed resistance. Most necrosis mutants also showed resistance to lethal thermal stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Moreover, it was previously reported that inhibition of necrosis can delay infection-induced death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Wong1">[47]</xref>. However, necrosis mutants showed little protection against death induced by oxidative stress (<italic>t</italic>-BOOH) (unpublished data). These findings suggest that some stressors cause death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by triggering systemic necrosis.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the release of AA from gut granules stimulates intestinal necrosis. To test this we first examined the effect of removing AA by <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) on resistance to heat stress, and found that resistance was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s017">Figure S17A</xref>–C). However, it was previously shown that <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) enhances proteostasis and lifespan by increasing Trp levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-vanderGoot1">[37]</xref>. To test whether <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) protects against heat stress by reducing AA, we asked if replenishment in <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) worms would suppress their stress resistance, but it did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s017">Figure S17C</xref>). Moreover, AA supplementation of N2 worms did not reduce heat stress resistance. Also in a range of mutants with altered AA levels there was no correlation with resistance to either thermal or osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s017">Figure S17D–E</xref>). Thus, heat stress resistance resulting from <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) is not caused by reduced AA but may instead reflect increased Trp levels. These results imply that DF does not promote intestinal cell necrosis but, rather, is a bystander phenomenon (or epiphenomenon).</p>
<p>We also tested the effect of insulin/IGF-1 signaling on DF. Mutation of the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin/IGF-1 receptor increases lifespan, and this effect requires the <italic>daf-16</italic> FoxO transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Kenyon1">[48]</xref>.

<p>In this study, we have shown that conserved mechanisms underpinning neuronal necrosis can also contribute to organismal death. In so doing we provide the first insights into the last biological events in the life history of <italic>C. elegans</italic>: those leading to its final demise. Identification of an endogenous fluorescent marker of death led us to discover a calcium-generated wave of necrotic cell death that occurs during, and can contribute to, organismal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001613-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

<title>Intercellular Propagation of Necrosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Death and Mammalian Neurodegeneration</title>
<p>Evidence presented here implies that during death in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the intestine, the largest somatic organ, undergoes a stereotyped process of self-destruction involving an intra- and intercellular cascade of cellular necrosis. The mechanisms involved are similar to those active in the propagation of cellular necrosis in mammals. In worms, necrotic propagation requires the innexin INX-16, while in mammals connexin (mammalian gap junction proteins) inactivation reduces ischemia-induced neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Wang1">[10]</xref>. Thus, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine is a potential new model for understanding the propagation of necrotic cell death, and its prevention.</p>
<p>Previous studies of the cellular necrosis pathway have largely focused on neurodegeneration, in mammals and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our findings imply similar action of this pathway in the worm intestine. However, generation of DF appears to be restricted to the intestine, and is not detectable in necrotic <italic>mec-4(d)</italic> neurons (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Our results imply that intestinal self-destruction by systemic necrosis occurs during both stress- and aging-induced death. However, only in stress-induced death did inhibition of systemic necrosis prevent death. This suggests that while lethal stress causes death by inducing systemic necrosis, aging causes death by a number of processes acting in parallel, likely including systemic necrosis (given that it destroys a major organ). Here there are potential parallels in human aging: estimations of the likely upper limits of human longevity have calculated that removal of a major age-related disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer) would cause only small increases in lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Olshansky1">[49]</xref>. This is because multiple pathologies act in parallel to increase age-related mortality.</p>
<p>A feature of intestinal necrosis is its origin in the anterior int1 cells. This suggests that the unusual vulnerability of these cells to necrotic death might represent a breaking point within organismal homeostasis; analogously, in humans localized failure (e.g., in the heart or kidneys) can cause rapid organismal death. The existence of an anterior to posterior (A-P) Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is unexpected, given that the defecation-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave previously characterized in the intestine flows in the opposite direction, from posterior to anterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Peters1">[44]</xref>. How the A-P Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is specified is unknown. One possibility is that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are elevated near the anterior intestine, creating vulnerability to necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Nehrke2">[50]</xref>.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> Blue Fluorescence Is Not Lipofuscin</title>
<p>In this study we have defined a new phenomenon, death fluorescence, which may be useful in future as a marker of death in lifespan assays. While DF means that blue fluorescence cannot be used as a biomarker of aging we confirm that red fluorescence does increase with age. Moreover, <italic>tdo-2</italic>(RNAi) can be used to abrogate blue intestinal fluorescence to aid the viewing of expression of intestinally expressed fluorescent reporters.</p>
<p>The anthranilic acid glucosyl ester angl#1 and its corresponding 3′-phosphorylated derivative angl#2 account for both death and gut granule-associated fluorescence. <italic>glo-1</italic> mutants lack both forms of fluorescence and AA derivatives, and inhibition of the kynurenine pathway blocks both forms of fluorescence, establishing that this blue fluorescence is not lipofuscin. Whether lipofuscin accumulation occurs during aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains an open question. However, our finding that blue fluorescence is not lipofuscin removes one reason for believing that aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is caused by accumulation of stochastic molecular damage. The kynurenine pathway that generates gut granule and DF is also involved in mammalian neurodegeneration, and has recently been shown to regulate protein folding homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-vanderGoot1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Stone1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>During organismal death, AA fluorescence increases as a consequence of necrosis. That DF can occur in the absence of AA synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s010">Figure S10C–D</xref>) implies that the burst is not a consequence of synthesis of additional AA. One possibility is that AA fluorescence within gut granules is partially quenched, perhaps due to low pH and/or increased concentration. In this scenario, loss of gut granule membrane integrity causes rapid dequenching of AA fluorescence, leading to the burst. In a similar fashion, dequenching of uranin fluorescence upon gut granule permeabilization leads to a burst of green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001613.s011">Figure S11</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether cellular necrosis in other organisms leads to increased AA fluorescence, but increases in blue fluorescence accompanying cell death have been reported—e.g., in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Liang1">[52]</xref> and hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Anderson1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>Possible Functions of Anthranilic Acids and Systemic Necrosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Despite their prominence, <italic>C. elegans</italic> gut granules are organelles whose function has yet to be established. The finding that they contain large quantities of AA further adds to the mystery. What is all this anthranilic acid for? Possibilities include protection against UV irradiation, or against pathogen invasion into the intestine. Notably, AA can be cytotoxic; for example, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can induce cell death in lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Piscianz1">[54]</xref> and neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Smith1">[55]</xref>, and AA can inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens (e.g., <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Sasaki1">[56]</xref>. This might explain its presence in multiple species of soil nematodes.</p>
<p>The presence of a mechanism, systemic necrosis, that brings about organismal death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> raises questions about its evolutionary origin. Could such an organismal self-destruct mechanism serve as an adaptation? When food is limiting, gravid hermaphrodites typically die with multiple embryos in their uterus, which hatch internally and consume their mother's corpse (“bagging”). Potentially, this improves the mother's fitness by increasing survival of her genetically identical offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-McCulloch1">[57]</xref>. One possibility, then, is that systemic necrosis enhances fitness by aiding efficient transfer of nutrients from mother to offspring during bagging. Alternatively, systemic necrosis may be the nonadaptive product of antagonist pleiotropy, or a quasi-program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Blagosklonny1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Williams1">[59]</xref>. By this view, elements of the necrosis cascade contribute to early life fitness, while systemic necrosis is an unselected, deleterious consequence of their action under lethal stress or as a result of aging.</p>

<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Whole worm sonicates were prepared in dH<sub>2</sub>O from large heterogeneous populations grown on NGM plates. Sonication was performed in repeated cycles of 1 min followed by a 30 s pause for cooling in a “Bioruptor” water bath sonicator (Diagenode) until samples were homogenously clouded. Samples were spun down at 4°C at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant extracted. Cold 100% ethanol was added in a 1∶9 sample∶ethanol ratio and left at −20°C overnight. Samples were spun down again as above. The remaining supernatant was taken. Samples were then evaporated in vacuum at room temperature. For NMR-spectroscopic analysis, the residues were dissolved in 200–600 µL of methanol-d4. Following NMR-spectroscopic analysis, samples were evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 500 µL methanol, centrifuged, and 1–30 µL aliquots were used for HPLC-MS analysis.</p>

<p>Adapting a previously described procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001613-Roell1">[66]</xref>, a catalytic amount (∼1 mg, 0.025 mmol) of sodium hydroxide was added to a solution of 75 mg (0.462 mmol) of isatoic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich, I12808) and 250 mg (0.462 mmol) of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucopyranose (Sigma-Aldrich, 86730) in 4 mL dioxane. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated gradually until moderate evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> occurred (75–90°C). This temperature was maintained until gas evolution ceased (2 h) and the mixture was cooled and diluted with 6 ml of water. Crude 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucosyl anthranilic acid ester, containing both the a and b isomers, separated out as an immiscible oil and was extracted with methylene chloride (yield 255 mg, 84%). To deprotect the glucose moiety, this mixture of products was dissolved in ethyl acetate (10 ml) to which 10% palladium on activated carbon (28 mg) was added, and the resulting suspension was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere for 24 h. Subsequently, the reaction vessel was flushed with argon, and the reaction mixture was filtered over Celite and the filtrate evaporated to dryness <italic>in vacuo</italic>.
