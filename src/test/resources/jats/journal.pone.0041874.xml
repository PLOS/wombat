        <p>The biosynthesis of rubber is thought to take place on the surface of rubber particles in laticifers, highly specialized cells that are present in more than 40 plant families. The small rubber particle protein (SRPP) has been supposed to be involved in rubber biosynthesis, and recently five SRPPs (TbSRPP1–5) were identified in the rubber-producing dandelion species <italic>Taraxacum brevicorniculatum</italic>. Here, we demonstrate by immunogold labeling that TbSRPPs are localized to rubber particles, and that rubber particles mainly consist of TbSRPP3, 4 and 5 as shown by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis. We also carried out an RNA-interference approach in transgenic plants to address the function of TbSRPPs in rubber biosynthesis as well as rubber particle morphology and stability. TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> plants showed a 40–50% reduction in the dry rubber content, but neither the rubber weight average molecular mass nor the polydispersity of the rubber were affected. Although no phenotypical differences to wild-type particles could be observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, rubber particles from the TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic lines were less stable and tend to rapidly aggregate in expelling latex after wounding of laticifers. Our results prove that TbSRPPs are very crucial for rubber production in <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic>, probably by contributing to a most favourable and stable rubber particle architecture for efficient rubber biosynthesis and eventually storage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Approximately 2,500 plants produce natural rubber poly (<italic>cis</italic>-1,4-isoprene), which is stored in rubber particles dispersed throughout the cytosol of either laticifers or specialized parenchyma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Cornish1">[1]</xref>. Natural rubber is synthesized by the successive addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to an initiating allylic pyrophosphate, e.g. farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Cornish1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Kharel1">[5]</xref>. This polymerization reaction is thought to take place on the surface of rubber particles, mediated by a particle bound <italic>cis</italic>-prenyltransferase (CPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Cornish1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Archer1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt1">[8]</xref>. Recently, we identified three rubber particle bound long-chain CPTs in <italic>Taraxacum brevicorniculatum</italic> (<italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> was erroneously labeled as <italic>T. koksaghyz</italic> in botanical gardens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Kirschner1">[9]</xref>) that appear to be the key enzymes for rubber biosynthesis in this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Post1">[10]</xref>. Detailed analysis of rubber particles in different species revealed a conserved spherical structure with sizes ranging from 0.2–6.5 µm in <italic>Ficus carica</italic> and <italic>Ficus benghalensis</italic>, 1–2 µm in <italic>Parthenium argentatum,</italic> 0.08–2 µm in <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> and 0.01–1 µm in <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Gomez1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Singh1">[13]</xref>. Rubber particles comprise a homogenous rubber core surrounded by a monolayer membrane containing lipids, proteins, and several minor compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Cornish3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Siler2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Wood1">[15]</xref>. This composite monolayer membrane probably mediates the colloidal stability of rubber particles by providing a net negative surface charge that prevents their coalescence in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Cornish3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Siler2">[14]</xref>. In principle, colloidal stability depends on the balance between repulsion and attractive van-der-Waals forces, and electrostatic forces are often responsible for the repulsion of colloids in a suspension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Verwey1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Riddick1">[18]</xref>. The net surface charge of colloids can be estimated by the determination of their zeta (ζ)-potential, which is the electrical potential difference at the interface of the suspending fluid and the stationary fluid attached to the colloid surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Verwey1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Riddick1">[18]</xref>. In addition to repulsion through a similar (positive or negative) surface charge, repulsion of colloids can also be mediated by steric hindrance of adsorbed large molecules, such as proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Heller1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Jucker1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Grasso1">[22]</xref>. Amongst others, two highly homologous proteins are associated with the surface of <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> rubber particles, i.e. the small rubber particle protein (SRPP; here designated as HbSRPP) and the rubber elongation factor (REF; here designated as HbREF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Dennis1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Oh1">[25]</xref>. SRPP homologs were also identified in <italic>P. argentatum</italic> (guayule homolog of SRPP, GHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Kim1">[26]</xref>) and <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> (TbSRPP1–5, previously designated as TkSRPP1–5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt2">[27]</xref>). The functions of SRPP and REF are yet unclear. However, there is some evidence indicating a potential role in rubber biosynthesis: <italic>In vitro</italic>-experiments revealed that the addition of recombinant HbSRPP to <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> rubber particles suspended in latex cytosol increased the incorporation of IPP, while addition of antibodies directed against HbSRPP and HbREF inhibited IPP incorporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Dennis2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Oh1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, the analysis of HbREF gene expression in <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> accessions with low to high rubber yields revealed that HbREF expression correlates positively with the amount of rubber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Priya1">[28]</xref>. However, it has been proposed that the rubber-producing species <italic>F. carica</italic> and <italic>F. benghalensis</italic> do not possess a SRPP homolog, suggesting that SRPP is not a general and essential protein for rubber biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Singh1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The recently identified SRPPs in <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> (TbSRPP1–5) shared sequence identities of 41–66% to each other and 38–43% with HbSRPP. Except for TbSRPP2, all TbSRPPs are predominately expressed in latex and their spatiotemporal expression pattern correlates with latex and rubber production in <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt2">[27]</xref>. To analyze the function of TbSRPPs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> plants with strongly reduced TbSRPP protein levels, caused by RNA-interference. We revealed that exuded latex as well as freeze-dried roots of transgenic plants contain significantly lower amounts of natural rubber compared to wild-type plants. Rubber particles in expelling latex of transgenic plants appeared to be less stable compared to wild-type, whereas neither the rubber weight average molecular mass nor the polydispersity were affected. Hence, we conclude that TbSRPPs probably support rubber biosynthesis by the stabilization of rubber particles.</p>

        <p>We recently identified and cloned five genes (<italic>TbSRPP1–5</italic>) encoding small rubber particle proteins from <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt2">[27]</xref>.

We revealed a cluster of highly abundant protein spots with isoelectric point (pI) values between pH 4 and pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of these protein spots generated representative peptide sequences for TbSRPP2, TbSRPP3, TbSRPP4 and TbSRPP5, whereas no peptides were detected for TbSRPP1 (Tab. S1). The most abundant rubber particle protein was TbSRPP3, followed by TbSRPP4 and TbSRPP5, while TbSRPP2 was present only in small amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, Tab.

        <p>Next, the presence of TbSRPPs on rubber particles was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a polyclonal antibody raised against TbSRPP3. In Western blot experiments, this antibody recognized all TbSRPPs with the same efficiency, most probably due to the high amino acid sequence conservation between members of this protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Schmidt2">[27]</xref>, and will therefore be referred to as anti-TbSRPP (Fig. S1, Text S1). Immunogold labeling of rubber particles using anti-TbSRPP and a gold-coupled secondary antibody with subsequent visualization by SEM directly confirmed the presence of TbSRPPs on the rubber particle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

            <p><italic>TbSRPP</italic> transcription levels in the latex of three independent TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic lines (designated S3, S76 and S85) were quantified by RT-PCR.

The ratios of <italic>TbSRPPs</italic>/<italic>TbACTIN</italic> transcription levels in wild-type (wt) served as a reference and were set to the value of one.

      <p>In this study we showed that the three SRPP homologs TbSRPP3, 4 and 5 are the major rubber particle proteins in <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> and confirmed their association with rubber particles by immunogold labeling and SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, Tab. S1). While we were also able to detect small amounts of TbSRPP2 at the rubber particle surface, TbSRPP1 seems to be not or only in non-detectable amounts (by 2D-gel electrophoresis) associated with the rubber particle surface, since no peptide sequences for TbSRPP1 could be detected. This could result from the washing steps during the purification procedure applied to the rubber particles by which more loosely associated proteins might detach from the rubber particle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, Tab. S1). In <italic>H. brasiliensis,</italic> the closely related proteins HbREF and HbSRPP are also associated with rubber particles, whereby HbREF is the most abundant rubber particle protein followed by HbSRPP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Singh1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Dennis2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Oh1">[25]</xref>. HbREF and HbSRPP as well as their homolog GHS from <italic>P. argentatum</italic> have been supposed to positively influence rubber biosynthesis: It has been shown that heterologously expressed GST-HbSRPP as well as His-GHS fusion proteins enhance IPP incorporation activity of rubber particles <italic>in vitro</italic>, while immunoinhibition by appropriate HbREF and HbSRPP antibodies reduces the IPP incorporation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Dennis2">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Kim1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, it has been suggested that HbSRPP is part of the rubber transferase complex or that it is involved in the synthesis or recruitment of substrates for rubber biosynthesis initiation and/or rubber chain elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Oh1">[25]</xref>. However, Singh and co-workers speculated that SRPP is not crucial for rubber biosynthesis since its detection on <italic>F. carica</italic> and <italic>F. benghalensis</italic> rubber particles by immunogold labeling with an HbSRPP antibody failed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Singh1">[13]</xref>. As SRPP homologs have been detected in species that produce rubber of high molecular mass (<italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>P. argentatum</italic>) but not in species possessing only low molecular mass rubber (<italic>F. carica</italic> and <italic>F. benghalensis</italic>), it has been supposed that HbSRPP and GHS might be important factors for determination of the rubber molecular mass by assisting CPT function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Kim1">[26]</xref>. Due to the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence, the roles of SRPP, REF, and GHS in rubber biosynthesis have yet not been sufficiently proven.</p>
      <p>To elucidate the role of TbSRPPs in rubber biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic plants expressing an RNAi construct directed against <italic>TbSRPPs</italic>. Quantitative RT-PCR and 2-D gel electrophoresis with subsequent immunodetection using the anti-TbSRPP antibody confirmed that expression of all TbSRPPs was severely silenced in the transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). By determination of the dry rubber content from exuded latex and freeze-dried roots we were able to show that the TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic plants contained significantly lower amounts of natural rubber compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041874-t001">Tab. 1</xref>) indicating an impaired rubber biosynthesis in the TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic lines. In contrast, SEC-analysis of the rubber samples revealed a wild-type like rubber chain elongation since neither the weight average molecular mass nor the polydispersity was affected by reduced TbSRPP protein levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041874-t001">Tab. 1</xref>). Therefore, we propose that TbSRPPs are not mandatory for the formation of high molecular mass rubber. Instead, the rubber biosynthesis seems to be less effective in TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic plants, probably resulting from an inefficient enzymatic activity of the long-chain prenyltransferase (TbCPT1–3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Post1">[10]</xref>, as also suggested by the data obtained from the <italic>in vitro</italic> prenyltransferase assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0041874-t001">Tab. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Rubber particles are not only required for the storage of rubber molecules, but also to provide a suitable and stable platform for rubber biosynthesis. Although one could expect that the depletion of major integral rubber particle proteins might have a dramatic effect on the morphology of rubber particles, TEM-analysis of ultra-thin cross sections of laticifers revealed no obvious differences in the architecture of rubber particles from TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic and wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, TbSRPPs appear not to contribute to the surface charge and subsequently to the electrostatic repulsion of rubber particles since both, rubber particles from TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic and wild-type plants showed a nearly identical ζ-potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This is in consistence with results obtained for <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> rubber particles, whose negative surface charge is mainly derived from adsorbed long chain fatty acids and only little from proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Ho1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Depletion of the rubber particle surface charge by suspending rubber particles in a buffer with a pH-value close to their isoelectric point led to an increase of their z-average diameter, indicating the formation of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggests that electrostatic repulsion contributes to a great extent to the colloidal stability of <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> rubber particles. Nevertheless, even at pH 7.2 the rubber particle ζ-potential of approximately −18 mV remains insufficient for electrostatic force to solely provide particle stabilization, which requires a ζ-potential of at least ±30 mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Riddick1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Genovese1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, the colloidal stability of <italic>T. brevicorniculatum</italic> rubber particles is not exclusively mediated by electrostatic repulsion. This is strongly supported by the fact that the depletion of TbSRPPs, which have no impact on the rubber particle surface charge, led to a significant increase of the z-average diameter of rubber particles from TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic plants compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Microscopic analysis of purified rubber particles using CLSM and TEM confirmed that even at pH 7.2, where the surface charge of the rubber particles is considerably high, rubber particles from TbSRPP-RNAi transgenic plants aggregated intensely, while wild-type particles remained solitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g004">Fig. 4A, C–H</xref>). Therefore, we suppose that in addition to the electrostatic repulsion of rubber particles (most probably provided by their membrane lipids) TbSRPPs contribute to their stabilization by steric hindrance. This is supported by the fact that at low surface charges rubber particles from TbSRPP<italic>-</italic>RNAi transgenic plants showed an even more intensive aggregation compared to wild-type particles, suggesting an additive effect of electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion mediated by TbSRPPs as also considered for other colloidal systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041874-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Jucker1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Grasso1">[22]</xref>. Accordingly, the monolayer-membrane surrounded seed oil bodies are sterically stabilized by oleosin, their major surface protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Tzen1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Peng1">[35]</xref>. The assumption that proteins on the surface of rubber particles contribute to their stability is also supported by the fact that <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> rubber particles become unstable when treated with proteolytic enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041874-Sansatsadeekul1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data obtained by photon correlation spectroscopy of rubber particles suggest that TbSRPPs are involved in the stabilization of the rubber particle membrane. As a consequence, TbSRPPs-depleted rubber particles may not provide a suitable environment for the CPT and subsequently efficient IPP-polymerization. To gain deeper insight into the functional role of individual SRPPs in rubber biosynthesis, it will be necessary to generate transcript specific knock-down plants and to analyze their respective effect on rubber biosynthesis and rubber particle biogenesis as well as rubber particle architecture and stability.</p>
