This directory (src/test/resources/) is a general webapp container for files
that need to be available as resources in tests.

The "resource/" directory within it (src/test/resources/resource/) simulates
the "resource/" directory that exists in a theme. It contains static resources
that the webapp would serve from the theme to a client, such as JavaScript
files. Hence it contains JavaScript files used in AssetServiceTest.

We apologize for the redundancy.
