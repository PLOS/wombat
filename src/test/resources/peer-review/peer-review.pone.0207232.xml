        <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a method to compare two
        commonly used algorithms, AAA and AXB, in treatment
        planning system for calculating the dose. The authors
        present the details of calculation results of using both
        algorithms under different grid sizes. The authors position
        the manuscript as a paper comparing the dose calculation
        results for the prostate cancer treatment with ERB, and the
        authors state that the AXB with 2 mm grid size is an
        endeavour worth undertaking for achieving the dose
        calculation accuracy and speed for prostate cancer
        treatment. However, the authors fail to make a clear and
        logical comparison for the results of two algorithms on
        their defined treatment plan. Overall, this manuscript
        reads like an experiment report with plain and simple
        analysis. Quite less insight and conclusion are made for
        the why and how the algorithm selection is made, instead,
        the authors spend a great deal of efforts to present and
        data in tables and figures. Moreover, the potential
        contradictions for reasoning the algorithm selection
        process are not considered. For instance, the authors state
        &#226;&#8364;&#339;As a result, the AAA predicted a higher
        dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could
        consequently estimate better target coverage than
        AXB.&#226;&#8364;, &#226;&#8364;&#339;Therefore, the
        calculated TCP of AAA was relatively higher than that of
        AXB, and the TCP differences among the algorithms showed a
        quite large variations (4.05%), which were statistically
        significant (p-value &lt;0.01).&#226;&#8364;, and
        &#226;&#8364;&#339;However, the HI of AAA was less than
        that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more
        homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the
        reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when
        using AXB.</p>
        <p>&#226;&#8364;, etc., these observations apparently show
        that AAA can have merits on some perspective that the
        authors introduced for evaluating its performance. So, does
        that mean that the better performance of AAA algorithm in
        these perspectives is not enough to consider applying it to
        this defined treatment study? If so, what is the premise of
        making this selection? The authors seem to need to design a
        well-defined evaluation structure to compare the
        performance of the algorithm, such as making a rank for
        different evaluation parameters as the authors introduced
        in the paper or weighting the performance of the algorithm
        on these parameters. The authors need to tell the potential
        readers what the premise of is comparing two algorithms,
        and why and how to make a reasonable and sound selection
        for them. Based on the presentation in this manuscript,
        however, the authors&#226;&#8364;&#8482; effort alone now
        is sufficient to justify publication as an article for
        recommending a dose calculation algorithm for the prostate
        cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>By applying the two algorithms in the prostate treatment
        with ERB and comparing the performances of the selected
        algorithm from many perspectives is a good idea, will
        certainly be of interest to the readership of the Plos One.
        However, the authors fall short of their goal to provide a
        systematical and logical comparison of two algorithms. With
        substantial revisions, including attending to English
        grammar, a demonstration of the comparison standards, more
        sound algorithm selection rules, this article could be
        reconsidered for publication.</p>
        <p>Some minor comments are made in the manuscript, the
        author may read them.</p>
        <p>Reviewer #2: Grid size is an important parameter in
        treatment planning. The authors generated VMAT plans using
        anisotropic analytical algorithm and Acuros XB algorithm
        with different grid sizes, and compared the dosimetric and
        radiobiological parameters. The paper is manuscript is
        well-organized.</p>
        <p>1. Page 4. Materials and methods. Can you provide the
        weight of these prostate patients? If possible, provide
        some information about the variations of inter-patient
        anatomy. Is the anatomy related with the performance of
        algorithms and grid sizes? Or your selected patients can be
        representatives for most clinical cases?</p>
        <p>2. line 169. Why did you select AXB1 as reference plans?
        Why not AAA1? Do you have specific reasons?</p>
        <p>3. Table 3. In V95%, Dmedian, Dmean, Dmin and CN, AXB3
        is larger than AXB1 and AXB2.</p>
        <p>AAA1 is mostly larger than AAA3 and AAA5, which makes
        sense to me, longer calculation time generate more accurate
        results. Can you explain why AXB has different trends along
        the grid size, compared with AAA? Shorter time, but more
        accurate results (AXB3 )?</p>
        <p>4. It would be solid if you have dosimetric measurement
        or Monte Carlo calculation. Given so many plan calculation
        data, it is not easy to determine which one is more
        accurate.</p>
        <p>5. Table 4. Too many data were listed. It would be
        better to present them in a more readable way, which also
        leads to a conclusion.</p>
        <p>6. Table 8. Why did you compared AAA 1mm with AXB 3 mm?
        Why not AAA 1 mm and AXB 1mm? Please explain this.</p>
        <p>7. Figure 2,3,4. It may confuse reader using so many
        colors in the subtraction image (AXB-AAA). The image
        resolution is not good enough. Please use a high quality
        figure or use two figure (without negative dose) to present
        AXB&gt;AAA and AXB&lt;aaa, respectively.=""&gt;</p>

        <p>Title: Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison in
        different dose calculation grid sizes between Acuros XB and
        anisotropic analytical algorithm for prostate VMAT</p>
        <p>Manuscript Number: PONE-D-18-18642</p>
        <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a method to compare two
        commonly used algorithms, AAA and AXB, in treatment
        planning system for calculating the dose. The authors
        present the details of calculation results of using both
        algorithms under different grid sizes. The authors position
        the manuscript as a paper comparing the dose calculation
        results for the prostate cancer treatment with ERB, and the
        authors state that the AXB with 2 mm grid size is an
        endeavour worth undertaking for achieving the dose
        calculation accuracy and speed for prostate cancer
        treatment. However, the authors fail to make a clear and
        logical comparison for the results of two algorithms on
        their defined treatment plan. Overall, this manuscript
        reads like an experiment report with plain and simple
        analysis. Quite less insight and conclusion are made for
        the why and how the algorithm selection is made, instead,
        the authors spend a great deal of efforts to present and
        data in tables and figures. Moreover, the potential
        contradictions for reasoning the algorithm selection
        process are not considered. For instance, the authors state
        &#226;&#8364;&#339;As a result, the AAA predicted a higher
        dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could
        consequently estimate better target coverage than
        AXB.&#226;&#8364;, &#226;&#8364;&#339;Therefore, the
        calculated TCP of AAA was relatively higher than that of
        AXB, and the TCP differences among the algorithms showed a
        quite large variations (4.05%), which were statistically
        significant (p-value &lt;0.01).&#226;&#8364;, and
        &#226;&#8364;&#339;However, the HI of AAA was less than
        that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more
        homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the
        reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when
        using AXB.&#226;&#8364;, etc., these observations
        apparently show that AAA can have merits on some
        perspective that the authors introduced for evaluating its
        performance. So, does that mean that the better performance
        of AAA algorithm in these perspectives is not enough to
        consider applying it to this defined treatment study? If
        so, what is the premise of making this selection? The
        authors seem to need to design a well-defined evaluation
        structure to compare the performance of the algorithm, such
        as making a rank for different evaluation parameters as the
        authors introduced in the paper or weighting the
        performance of the algorithm on these parameters. The
        authors need to tell the potential readers what the premise
        of is comparing two algorithms, and why and how to make a
        reasonable and sound selection for them. Based on the
        presentation in this manuscript, however, the
        authors&#226;&#8364;&#8482; effort alone now is sufficient
        to justify publication as an article for recommending a
        dose calculation algorithm for the prostate cancer
        treatment.</p>
        <p>By applying the two algorithms in the prostate treatment
        with ERB and comparing the performances of the selected
        algorithm from many perspectives is a good idea, will
        certainly be of interest to the readership of the Plos One.
        However, the authors fall short of their goal to provide a
        systematical and logical comparison of two algorithms. With
        substantial revisions, including attending to English
        grammar, a demonstration of the comparison standards, more
        sound algorithm selection rules, this article could be
        reconsidered for publication.</p>
        <p>Some minor comments are made in the manuscript, the
        author may read them.</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your thoughtful advice. We compared the
        dose calculation algorithms embedded in commercialized
        Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems,
        Palo Alto, CA, USA), and the prerequisite of this study is
        that AXB has a more accurate dose calculation capability
        than AAA. Actually, we've already confirm the AXB and AAA
        performance in a rectangular acryl phantom with an air
        cavity by EBT3 film dosimetry in our previous studies.
        However, unlike the phantom, patients have various anatomy,
        and the treatment plan is also complicate depending on
        treatment technique, cancer type, and treatment site.
        Although AXB has been found to be more accurate in previous
        studies, due to those complexities in practice, dose
        calculation performance of both algorithms may be affected,
        as well as, also AXB dose calculation times are longer than
        AAA. Those are important clinical considerations in
        practice. Therefore, we selected the prostate cancer VMAT
        to investigate the appropriate algorithm for the clinics at
        a reasonable calculation time without significantly
        compromising accuracy. Next, we explained the meaning of
        the problematic sentence again.</p>
        <p>&#226;&#8364;&#339;As a result, the AAA predicted a
        higher dose to the air cavity within the PTV and could
        consequently estimate better target coverage than
        AXB.&#226;&#8364;</p>
        <p>Our response: As reported in previous studies, it has
        been confirmed that AAA overestimate the dose when compared
        to the measured values at the air cavity and air-material
        interface. In the prostate VMAT with endorectal balloon,
        PTV may contain a portion of the ballooned rectum, where
        AAA overestimates the dose. However, this portion did not
        actually contain much dose, because this was air.
        Therefore, when using the AAA, target coverage is better
        than AXB, but in fact it is overestimation.</p>
        <p>&#226;&#8364;&#339;Therefore, the calculated TCP of AAA
        was relatively higher than that of AXB, and the TCP
        differences among the algorithms showed a quite large
        variations (4.05%), which were statistically significant
        (p-value &lt;0.01).&#226;&#8364;</p>
        <p>Our response: We used EUD-based TCP models. As described
        above, AAA predicted doses with overestimated errors in the
        air inside PTV than for AXB. This leads to the increase in
        EUD and TCP of AAA compared with AXB.</p>
        <p>&#226;&#8364;&#339;However, the HI of AAA was less than
        that of AXB, and the AAA plan evaluations were more
        homogeneous than those of AXB. This, specifically, was the
        reason for the low dose in the air cavity of the PTV when
        using AXB.&#226;&#8364;</p>
        <p>Our response: HI= (D2- D98)/D50 , where 2, D98, and D50
        represent the dose to 2%, 98%, and 50% volume for the PTV.
        High doses in PTV air caused the increase in D98, leading
        to the decrease in HI. However, the dose overestimated by
        AAA in PTV air is not accurate, therefore HI reduction of
        AAA did not guarantee the quality of a better treatment
        plan.</p>
        <p>In addition, we have refined some English grammar and
        expressions and reflected all minor comments.</p>
        <p>Another reminder: The corrected part can be identified
        as finding the yellow highlight marking in the manuscript.
        Thank you.</p>
        <p>Reviewer #2: Grid size is an important parameter in
        treatment planning. The authors generated VMAT plans using
        anisotropic analytical algorithm and Acuros XB algorithm
        with different grid sizes, and compared the dosimetric and
        radiobiological parameters. The paper is manuscript is
        well-organized.</p>
        <p>1. Page 4. Materials and methods. Can you provide the
        weight of these prostate patients? If possible, provide
        some information about the variations of inter-patient
        anatomy. Is the anatomy related with the performance of
        algorithms and grid sizes? Or your selected patients can be
        representatives for most clinical cases?</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>The hypothesis that your anatomy can be related to the
        performance of algorithms and grid size has plenty of
        potential and is a good idea to improve the quality of this
        study. However, we did not observe the internal anatomy of
        the patient and it is difficult to analyze it. Therefore,
        future studies about the above contents will be planned and
        carried out. As your comments, we have presented the
        patient&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s weight and related information
        in the manuscript. Patients who received VMAT for prostate
        cancer in our institution from April 2016 to April 2017
        were randomly selected for analysis. Thank you.</p>
        <p>2. line 169. Why did you select AXB1 as reference plans?
        Why not AAA1? Do you have specific reasons?</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>In this study, we intended to investigate appropriate
        dose grid size and algorithm for clinical use. We have
        confirmed that AXB is superior to AAA in dose calculation
        in heterogeneous media through previous studies. In
        general, a finer dose grid is recommended in dose
        calculation for precise and accurate dose prediction.
        Therefore, the most accurate AXB1 were selected as
        reference and compared with other cases (AXB2, AXB3, AAA1,
        AAA3, AAA5). The manuscript was modified to express the
        above contents well. Thank you.</p>
        <p>3. Table 3. In V95%, Dmedian, Dmean, Dmin and CN, AXB3
        is larger than AXB1 and AXB2. AAA1 is mostly larger than
        AAA3 and AAA5, which makes sense to me, longer calculation
        time generate more accurate results. Can you explain why
        AXB has different trends along the grid size, compared with
        AAA? Shorter time, but more accurate results (AXB3)?</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>Actually, it is difficult to explain clearly the trend
        of AXB through the results of this study. Possible causes
        we guess is as follows. It may be derived from the material
        composition process of the AXB. AXB required the material
        composition of voxels in the CT image by converting the
        Hounsfield unit to material derived mass density value. The
        automatic material composition is implemented with five
        biological materials divided according to the Hounsfield
        unit. When this material composition is performed on each
        dose voxel, the conversion of CT values might be affected
        by the size of the grid systematically. To clearly confirm
        this, well-designed studies should be conducted to assess
        this effect. This contents will included in discussion
        section.</p>
        <p>The general consensus was that finer dose calculation
        grid would produce more accurate dose at the cost of
        calculation time. Therefore, it is important to determine
        the optimized number of dose grid at a reasonable
        calculation time without significantly compromising
        accuracy. Comparing with a reference (AXB1), AXB3 showed
        dose calculation accuracy without significantly
        compromising accuracy, while the accuracy of AAA is clearly
        reduced. In addition, dose calculation time of AXB3 (262 s)
        was comparable with that of AAA3 (245 s). Thank you.</p>
        <p>4. It would be solid if you have dosimetric measurement
        or Monte Carlo calculation. Given so many plan calculation
        data, it is not easy to determine which one is more
        accurate.</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We have already
        compared the dose calculation performance of AXB and AAA in
        the air cavity by using a phantom with the EBT film
        measurement in our previous studies. As a result, we
        confirmed that AXB had more similar results than AAA to
        film measurements in the air cavity and air-material
        interface in phantom. However, the influence of dose
        calculation grids and algorithms were not clearly
        identified in some clinical cases, and may affect
        differently the plan quality depending on treatment scheme
        (planning complexity, treatment techniques, cancer, degree
        of inhomogeneity, etc.). To clarify the above and to
        evaluate the clinical usefulness, we intended to extend
        previous study in prostate cancer VMAT. In this study, we
        designed plan study to analyze the effects of dose
        calculation algorithm and grid on prostate VMAT.</p>
        <p>5. Table 4. Too many data were listed. It would be
        better to present them in a more readable way, which also
        leads to a conclusion.</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your comment. We decided to change the
        table to plotting with consideration for readable data
        representation.</p>
        <p>6. Table 8. Why did you compared AAA 1mm with AXB 3 mm?
        Why not AAA 1 mm and AXB 1mm? Please explain this.</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>The comparisons in Table 8 were as follows.</p>
        <p>(AAA1 vs AXB1), (AAA3 vs AXB3) ; between algorithms with
        same dose grid</p>
        <p>(AAA1 vs AAA3), (AAA1 vs AAA5) ; between AAAs with
        different dose grid</p>
        <p>(AXB1 vs AXB2), (AXB1 vs AXB3) ; between AXBs with
        different dose grid</p>
        <p>Since Table 8 was somewhat confusing, we described more
        details in the Table caption. Thank you.</p>
        <p>7. Figure 2,3,4. It may confuse reader using so many
        colors in the subtraction image (AXB-AAA). The image
        resolution is not good enough. Please use a high quality
        figure or use two figure (without negative dose) to present
        AXB&gt;AAA and AXB</p>
        <p>Our response:</p>
        <p>Depending on your comment, we will limit the color of
        the figure and submit a high-quality figure. In PDF
        version, the figures showed poor in spite of high-quality
        of originals. You can download a high-quality figure by
        clicking the link in the upper right corner of the figure
        page of the PDF. We uploaded the figure files to the
        Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital
        diagnostic tool to ensure that figures meet PLOS
        requirements. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Another reminder: The corrected part can be identified
        as finding the yellow highlight marking in the manuscript.

        <!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the manuscript
        technically sound, and do the data support the
        conclusions?</p>
        <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece
        of scientific research with data that supports the
        conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted
        rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and
        sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately
        based on the data presented.

        unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should
        be corrected at revision, so please note any specific

        <p>Reviewer #1: After the revision by the authors, the
        paper has a sound argument for what they proposed to
        investigating two well known dose calculation algorithms.
        Over all, the paper is in a good shape, and I would suggest
        a publication for this paper in Plos One.</p>
