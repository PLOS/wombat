  By default, print only an HTML comment indicating the build versions for developer use.

  A subtheme may override this file to provide additional information about the web server in the global page footer.
  For example, you may want to print the component version numbers (from the @buildInfo directive) in a human-readable
  format. Or you can acknowledge a hosting partner or list additional "Powered by..." credits.
