        <p>Following the emergence and global spread of a novel H1N1 influenza virus in 2009, two A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines produced from the A/California/07/09 H1N1 strain were selected and used for the national immunisation programme in the United Kingdom: an adjuvanted split virion vaccine and a non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine. In this study, we assessed the immune responses generated in inbred large white pigs (Babraham line) following vaccination with these vaccines and after challenge with A(H1N1)pdm/09 virus three months post-vaccination. Both vaccines elicited strong antibody responses, which included high levels of influenza-specific IgG1 and haemagglutination inhibition titres to H1 virus. Immunisation with the adjuvanted split vaccine induced significantly higher interferon gamma production, increased frequency of interferon gamma-producing cells and proliferation of CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (cytotoxic) and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (helper) T cells, after <italic>in vitro</italic> re-stimulation. Despite significant differences in the magnitude and breadth of immune responses in the two vaccinated and mock treated groups, similar quantities of viral RNA were detected from the nasal cavity in all pigs after live virus challenge. The present study provides support for the use of the pig as a valid experimental model for influenza infections in humans, including the assessment of protective efficacy of therapeutic interventions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an H1N1 influenza pandemic in response to the emergence and global spread of a novel H1N1 influenza A virus - A(H1N1)pdm/09 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html</ext-link>), which contained a unique combination of gene segments derived from multiple viruses that have been circulating in pigs for decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Garten1">[1]</xref>. Most A(H1N1)pdm/09 cases in humans resulted in mild illnesses, but in some people, more serious symptoms and fatalities have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Bautista1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the UK, two A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines produced from the A/California/07/09 H1N1 strain (Cal07) were used for the national immunisation programme: (i) Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A., GSK), an AS03b-adjuvanted split virion vaccine derived from embryonated chicken eggs, administered once in healthy adults, and (ii) Celvapan (Baxter AG), a non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine derived from Vero cell culture, administered twice with a minimum of 3 weeks between injections. These A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines were authorized under “Exceptional Circumstances” on the basis of limited to very limited safety and immunogenicity data obtained with these A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines and also utilised more complete safety and immunogenicity data obtained with H5N1 “mock-up” vaccines - e.g. similar versions of the A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines that contain the whole H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 influenza virus for the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine or the viral surface protein haemagglutinin (HA) derived from H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 for the adjuvanted split vaccine (product characteristics described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2010/01/WC500059182.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2010/01/WC500059182.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dossiers-sos-justice.com/media/00/01/1744671157.pdf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dossiers-sos-justice.com/media/00/01/1744671157.pdf</ext-link>, respectively). For both vaccines, the immunogenicity data at the time of authorization was based on the generation of anti-HA antibodies following vaccination with either the A(H1N1)pdm/09 and/or “mock-up” vaccines, and included some antigenic cross-reactivity data. For the adjuvanted split vaccine, non-clinical studies were solely based on results obtained following the vaccination and challenge of ferrets with the “mock-up” vaccine. For the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine, two non-clinical studies were performed in ferrets vaccinated with the “mock-up” vaccine and one study was performed in mice using the A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccine. Regarding the latter study, Kistner et al. recently reported that the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine provided protection against challenge with Cal07 with respect to undetectable virus titers in the lung tissue of vaccinated CD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Kistner1">[3]</xref>. Since these A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines were made available, several authors have reported that both were strongly immunogenic in adults and/or children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Madhun1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Waddington1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The generation of neutralising antibodies against antigenic sites on the HA glycoprotein of the influenza virus (as assessed by HA inhibition assay or microneutralisation assay) is regarded as the criterion for evaluating immunity to influenza viruses and is believed to constitute the main correlate of protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Waddington1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Hobson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-deJong1">[7]</xref>. Although cell-mediated immunity also correlates with the rate of viral clearance and protection of the respiratory tract after challenge with infectious influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Thomas1">[8]</xref>, cellular-mediated immune responses have not been assessed following vaccination with the A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines and only limited data is available on the cellular-mediated immune responses elicited by influenza vaccines in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Platt1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mice and ferrets are the most routinely used animal models for the study of influenza infections and in particular for the evaluation of human influenza vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Waffarn1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Haga1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, the pig is not currently considered as a major experimental model for influenza viruses, despite the fact that influenza viruses are enzootic in pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brown1">[12]</xref> and several studies show the pig as a valuable model to study human influenza viruses: human influenza viruses do replicate to a similar level in both the upper and lower respiratory tract explants of pigs, which exhibit a similar sialic acid receptor distribution and pattern of virus attachment to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-VanPoucke1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-vanRiel1">[14]</xref>, and infections of pigs with human influenza viruses under natural conditions occur regularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brown1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, several studies have now demonstrated in pigs the pathogenesis and transmission of A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza virus that emerged in 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Lange1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brookes1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Busquets1">[17]</xref>. In the present study, we assessed the immune responses generated to intramuscular immunisation with two commercial human influenza vaccines and challenge in inbred large white pigs (Babraham line).</p>

        <p>Two commercial A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines produced from Cal07 were used in this study: an AS03b-adjuvanted split virion vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A., GSK, Rixensart, Belgium) and a non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine (Celvapan, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria).</p>
        <p>The adjuvanted split virion vaccine was manufactured from a reassortant strain combining the HA, neuraminidase (NA) and viral polymerase subunit (PB1) genes of Cal07 and the PR8 strain backbone, generated by classical reassortment in embryonated chicken eggs. This vaccine was supplied as a suspension (antigen) and emulsion (adjuvant) multidose vial, and the volume after mixing one vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with one vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponded to ten doses of vaccine. One dose (0.5 ml) contained: (i) 3.75 µg HA antigen; (ii) the oil-in-water AS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 mg), DL-α-tocopherol (11.86 mg) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 mg); and (iii) the excipient thiomersal (5 mg). The vaccine vials were stored at 2–8°C and used within 24 hours following mixing.</p>
        <p>The non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine was manufactured from Cal07, grown in Vero cells and inactivated (formaldehyde and UV irradiation). This vaccine was supplied as a 5 ml multidose vial, corresponding to ten vaccine doses. One dose (0.5 ml) contained 7.5 µg HA antigen. The vaccine vials were stored at 2–8°C and used within 3 hours following opening of the vial.</p>

        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>Inbred large white pigs (Babraham line) were conventionally reared at the Institute for Animal Health (Compton, UK), with ages ranging from three to four months and weighing 15–29 kg at the initiation of the study. Prior to the study, all pigs were bled and shown by ELISA to be negative for anti-influenza A virus antibodies in the serum (i.e. not previously exposed to influenza A viruses). The pigs (three animals per group) were intramuscularly injected in the neck with one of the two commercial A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines mentioned above (0.5 ml per pig). The vaccination regime was similar to that recommended for adult humans: the adjuvanted split virion vaccine was administered only once, whereas the whole virion vaccine was administered twice (two doses three weeks apart). Another two pigs were mock-vaccinated, i.e. received a single intramuscular injection in the neck with 2.5 µl uninfected allantoic fluid (corresponding to approximately 7.5 µg total egg protein) diluted in a mixture of 0.25 ml PBS and 0.25 ml adjuvant (emulsion vial from the adjuvanted split virion vaccine) per pig. Blood samples were collected by anterior vena cava venepuncture at various time-points following vaccination.</p>
        <p>Three months after the initial vaccination, all pigs were intranasally inoculated with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of infectious A/England/195/09 H1N1 (Eng195 - 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/4 ml – 2 ml per nostril), using a mucosal atomisation device (MAD® Nasal, Wolfe Tory Medical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) to mimic aerogenous infection that results in the infection of both the upper and lower respiratory tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brookes1">[16]</xref>. This infectious virus strain was propagated in MDCK cells. Clinical parameters (demeanour, respiratory signs, faeces consistency and rectal temperature) were assessed and nasal swab samples were collected one day before and every day after challenge for 9 days. The swabs were stored in 1 ml RNAlater (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored frozen at −80°C until tested by a modified influenza A M gene real-time RT-PCR assay (RRT-PCR, as described below).</p>

        <p>Influenza-specific IgG1 and IgG2 Ab titres were quantified by ELISA using serum samples collected from each pig at various time points post-vaccination (pv). Both vaccines induced a significant systemic Ab response, which was predominantly of the IgG1 isotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032400-g001"><bold>Figure 1A and 1B</bold></xref>). Indeed, IgG1 titres were increased from −2.88±0.04LogEU at day 0pv to −0.53±0.15LogEU at day 33pv in pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine, whereas IgG2 titres only rose from −3.34±0.03LogEU at day 0pv to −1.75±0.21LogEU at day 33pv (n = 3). Similar results were obtained in pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine. Moreover, pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine produced significantly more specific IgG1 antibodies after one vaccination, compared to those vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine (−0.61±0.14LogEU versus −2.33±0.09LogEU at day 21pv, respectively, P&lt;0.05, n = 3). IgG1 Ab titres in pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine were however boosted after the second vaccination, and finally reached high titres by day 33pv (−1.34±0.16LogEU, n = 3). Nevertheless, IgG1 titres were significantly higher for animals vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine compared to those vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine from day 12pv to day 93pv (P&lt;0.05, n = 3). Noticeably, both IgG1 and IgG2 Ab titres were significantly increased following intranasal challenge with infectious Eng195 influenza virus in all pigs vaccinated with the A(H1N1)pdm/09 influenza vaccines. At day 100pv (i.e. day 7 post-challenge), IgG1 and IgG2 Ab titres respectively reached −0.29±0.11LogEU and −0.33±0.12LogEU for pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine, and 0.20±0.23LogEU and 0.14±0.18LogEU for pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine (n = 3). In contrast, influenza-specific IgG1 and IgG2 Ab titres were not increased in mock-vaccinated pigs at day 100pv, and it is likely this time-point was too early for their detection as high levels of Ab would only be expected from day 12–14 post-challenge in these naïve animals.</p>

        <p>Several T cell subsets in pigs have been identified on the basis of CD4 and CD8 cell surface expression, and are generally defined as follows: naïve/non-activated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells, cytotoxic CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CTL) and memory/activated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (T<sub>helper</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Ober1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Sinkora1">[22]</xref>.

In contrast, a significant influenza-driven recall response was only generated in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> subset (6±1% CFSE<sup>low</sup> cells, P&lt;0.01, n = 3), but not in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets (1±0% and 2±0.3% CFSE<sup>low</sup> cells, P&gt;0.94, n = 3), in pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032400-g003"><bold>Figure 3B–D</bold></xref>).

Similar results were obtained when using PBMC isolated on the day of challenge (day 93pv, data not shown).

        <p>Three months after the initial vaccination (day 93pv), all pigs were challenged intra-nasally with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of infectious Eng195 influenza virus. No or very mild clinical signs were observed in all pigs following this infectious challenge. Indeed, these clinical signs were: one animal in the group vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine exhibited sneezing at day 2 post-challenge (pc) and one animal in the mock-vaccinated group showed some nasal discharge at days 6pc and 7pc (data not shown).

Indeed, all shedding curves were biphasic with a first peak of nasal shedding occurring at day 2pc (32,240±4,180 REU, 33,622±969 REU and 205,233±154,813 REU for pigs vaccinated with the mock vaccine, the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine and the adjuvanted split vaccine, respectively) and a second peak at day 4pc (10,792±1,561 REU, 9,627±8,703 REU and 1,271±882 REU for pigs vaccinated with the mock vaccine, the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine and the adjuvanted split vaccine, respectively), followed by a gradual decrease thereafter. Overall, there were no significant differences (P&gt;0.25) in the levels of viral RNA detected between animals receiving different vaccines at any time point post challenge. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between animals in the total amount of viral RNA detected (i.e. area-under-the-curve, AUC) regardless of the vaccine received (P = 0.76).</p>

      <p>The choice of using the pig as a model in the present study was based on the following: (i) Swine influenza viruses are enzootic in pigs, with classical swine H1N1, “avian-like” H1N1, “human-like” H1N2 and “human-” and “avian-like” H3N2 subtypes of influenza A being reported world-wide in pig populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brown1">[12]</xref>; (ii) Human and swine influenza viruses replicate to similar levels in the upper and lower respiratory tract of pigs with a similar viral shedding pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-VanPoucke1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brookes1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Busquets1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Vijaykrishna1">[23]</xref> and (iii) The pig respiratory tract exhibits a distribution of sialic acid (Sia) with α2-6 (Siaα2-6Gal, preferred receptor for human influenza virus) and α2,3 (Siaα2-3Gal, preferred receptor for avian influenza virus) linkages to galactose and a pattern of virus attachment similar to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-VanPoucke1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-vanRiel1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, the Babraham inbred pigs are particularly valuable for performing immunological studies since these pigs are 85% identical as assessed by genome-wide SNP analysis (Alan Archibald, personal communication) and are matched for MHC type I and type II molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Binns1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, the genetic similarity between individual Babraham pigs also justifies the use of a lower number of animals per group (as compared to studies using outbred pigs), while allowing the assessment and dissection of the immune response in greater detail.</p>
      <p>The influenza-specific Ab responses in the serum of vaccinated pigs were dominated by the IgG1 isotype. Such a bias towards an IgG1-dominated response has previously been demonstrated in pigs immunised with other antigens, e.g. ovalbumin or foot-and-mouth disease virus subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-deAvilaBotton1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Tachedjian1">[26]</xref>. Pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine exhibited a significantly higher IgG1 response after one vaccination as compared to pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine. However, IgG1 titres in the latter pigs were boosted after the second vaccination, and finally reached high titres (although significantly lower than those in pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine). Interestingly, both influenza-specific IgG1 and IgG2 titres increased following challenge with Eng195 influenza virus. This suggests that the A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines assessed in this study mostly generated influenza-specific IgG1 antibodies, in contrast to infection with live virus that generated a more balanced and broader immune response. Pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine also generated significantly higher HI titres after one vaccination, and pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine showed a good HI response only after the boost vaccination (although lower than that observed in pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine). Very little data is available on the duration of neutralising antibody responses in human subjects vaccinated with these two commercial A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines. Recently, Madhun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Madhun1">[4]</xref> reported that health care workers vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine exhibited high HI titres 21 days after the vaccination (geometric mean titre = 473.5) that were decreased three months later (geometric mean titre = 232.2). Based on this report, HI titres in human subjects were slightly higher than in pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine, and were slightly decreased in both species two to three months later. In another report, Waddington et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Waddington1">[5]</xref> showed that HI titres in children vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine ranged from 60.3 to 79.6 at day 21 after the second vaccination, which is comparable to the HI values observed in pigs at day 12 after the second vaccination in our study (range 32–64). Nevertheless, duration of neutralising antibody responses could not be compared between pigs and humans from this report since the authors did not assess HI titres in these children at later time-points. HI values in children vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine could not be compared since these children did not receive one but two injections of the vaccine.</p>
      <p>In response to <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of PBMC with inactivated H1N1 influenza virus, we detected a peak of IFNγ-producing cells and IFNγ production at day 7pv, but only in pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine. Such an anamnestic response in the number of influenza-specific IFNγ-producing cells in the blood has similarly been detected only at day 7 after the challenge of pigs with A/Sw/Indiana/1726/88 H1N1 swine influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Larsen1">[27]</xref>. The authors of this study further showed this response was enhanced and detectable for a longer period of time (up to day 21 post-challenge) in the spleen, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and nasal mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Larsen1">[27]</xref>. Using CFSE labelling and flow cytometry, we determined the identity of the T cell subsets with the capacity to proliferate in response to an <italic>in vitro</italic> re-stimulation with inactivated H1N1 influenza virus. In addition to the classical CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, pig PBMCs are also known to contain a substantial number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. Importantly, these CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express CD8αα (not CD8αβ) molecule, are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted and are generally considered as memory/activated T<sub>helper</sub> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Ober1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Sinkora1">[22]</xref>. Our results demonstrated an influenza-specific recall response in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> (naïve), the CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (CTL) and the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (T<sub>helper</sub>) cells of pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine, but only in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (T<sub>helper</sub>) cells of pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine. It is tempting to speculate that the lack of IFNγ response observed in pigs vaccinated with the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine (even following the boost vaccination) may reflect the incapacity or at least the low efficiency of the non-adjuvanted whole vaccine to elicit an influenza-specific CTL response in these pigs. These killed vaccines are likely to stimulate CTL responses by cross-priming. It has been previously shown that some adjuvants have the ability to strongly enhance antigen cross-presentation (including that of peptide or protein antigen) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Jelinek1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Zaks1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-LeBon1">[30]</xref>. AS03 adjuvant contained in the adjuvanted split vaccine is known to induce local inflammation and recruitment of various innate immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Coffman1">[31]</xref>, and may similarly enhance antigen cross-presentation.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that both vaccines elicited systemic humoral responses and one of these (adjuvanted split vaccine) also elicited an enhanced cell-mediated immune response, none of the pigs were protected from a subsequent virus challenge at 3 months post-vaccination as viral RNA continued to be detected in the nasal cavity. Interestingly, although it has previously been shown that pigs with an HI titre equal to or above 20 were generally protected from a subsequent influenza challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Kyriakis1">[32]</xref>, two out of the three pigs vaccinated with the adjuvanted split vaccine still exhibited HI titres equal to or above 32 at the time of challenge but were nevertheless not protected. It is still unclear how the systemic responses generated after vaccination correlate with local mucosal responses in the respiratory tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Waffarn1">[10]</xref> that may also contribute to reduction in virus shedding. Interestingly, a similar study was conducted in ferrets, challenged six weeks after the initial vaccination, by the pandemic influenza vaccine evaluation consortium (PIVEC) that generated results consistent with our own findings. This study showed the A(H1N1)pdm/09 vaccines reduced (adjuvanted split vaccine) or had no effect on (non-adjuvanted whole vaccine) the viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract, although the adjuvanted split vaccine did prevent viral replication in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0032400-Brookes2">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present study provides support for the use of the pig as a valid experimental model for influenza infections in humans, including the assessment of protective efficacy of therapeutic interventions. This animal model offers improvements over that of mice and ferrets with clinical, pathological and immune responses similar to those induced in humans, and therefore has potential wide utility. The growing number of reagents to study the cell surface phenotype and function of immune cells in the pig will help dissect local and systemic responses. Moreover, the use of the inbred pig line will facilitate these investigations by allowing cell transfer studies and MHC I and II tetramer analysis.</p>
