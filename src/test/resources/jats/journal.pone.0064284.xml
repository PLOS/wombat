<abstract>
<p>The transcription factor PPARγ is the key regulator of adipocyte differentiation, function and maintenance, and the cellular target of the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones. Identification and functional characterization of genes regulated by PPARγ will therefore lead to a better understanding of adipocyte biology and may also contribute to the development of new anti-diabetic drugs. Here, we report carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 (Chst11/C4st1) as a novel PPARγ target gene. Chst11 can sulphate chondroitin, a major glycosaminoglycan involved in development and disease. The Chst11 gene contains two functional intronic PPARγ binding sites, and is up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Chst11 knockdown reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes, which is due to a lowered activity of lipoprotein lipase, which may associate with the adipocyte cell surface through Chst11-mediated sulfation of chondroitin, rather than impaired adipogenesis. Besides directly inducing Lpl expression, PPARγ may therefore control lipid accumulation by elevating the levels of Chst11-mediated proteoglycan sulfation and thereby increasing the binding capacity for Lpl on the adipocyte cell surface.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The close connections between obesity and its complications, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, has firmly established white adipose tissue as a key regulator of whole body glucose and lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Rosen1">[1]</xref>. White adipose tissue mainly regulates metabolism through storage of lipids (as triglycerides) and the secretion of so-called adipokines, which function in an endocrine or paracrine fashion. Several independent lines of research have firmly established the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activator γ (PPARy) as the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, maintenance and function. For example, <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of fibroblasts into mature white adipocytes can be induced by introduction of PPARγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Tontonoz1">[2]</xref>. In addition, this protein directly regulates a large set of “adipocyte genes” involved in lipid and glucose metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lefterova1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, PPARγ<sup>−/−</sup> mice are severely lipodystrophic, while PPAR γ<sup>+/−</sup> mice have reduced amounts of adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Barak1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Kubota1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nadra1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Rosen2">[8]</xref>. PPARγ is also essential for the maintenance of adipose tissue, since conditional knockout of the <italic>Pparg</italic> gene resulted in reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> survival of mature adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Imai1">[9]</xref>. Finally, human Familial partial lipodystrophy subtype 3 (FPLD3, MIM 604367) patients, harbouring heterozygous mutations in the <italic>PPARG</italic> gene, are characterized by aberrant fat distribution and metabolic disturbances, including insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Hegele1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>PPARγ activity can be stimulated by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of anti-diabetic drugs that includes rosiglitazone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-YkiJarvinen1">[11]</xref>. Since elevated levels of serum free fatty acids promote insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Boden1">[12]</xref>, an important potential mechanism for the beneficial effects of TZDs is therefore the net partitioning of lipids in adipose tissue. This may partly be explained by the PPARγ-mediated stimulatory effect of TZDs on adipocyte differentiation, resulting in increased lipid storage capacity in adipose tissue. In addition, PPARγ also directly regulates genes involved in all different aspects of lipid handling, such as lipid uptake (e.g. lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Schoonjans1">[13]</xref>), intracellular lipid transport (e.g. fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Tontonoz2">[14]</xref>) and lipid storage (e.g. perilipin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Dalen1">[15]</xref>), as well as anti-lipolytic genes (e.g. GPR81 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Jeninga1">[16]</xref>). While PPARγ is clearly a suitable pharmacological target, TZD use has unfortunately been linked to adverse side effects such as undesired weight gain, fluid retention, peripheral oedema, and potential increased risk of cardiac failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-YkiJarvinen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Gervois1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that a more restricted modulation of PPARγ activity may provide a new way of improving insulin sensitivity. A clear example of this is the recently identified phosphorylation site at serine 273 in PPARγ. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of serine 273 in PPARγ leads to deregulation of a subset of genes whose expression is altered in obesity including the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Choi1">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, S273 phosphorylation is blocked <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> by TZDs, but also by certain antidiabetic drugs that are weak PPARγ agonists or non-agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Choi1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-ChoiJH1">[19]</xref>. These findings indicate that a comprehensive view on the mechanisms regulating PPARγ activity as well as its downstream target genes is required to develop the next generation of PPARγ-based antidiabetic drugs.</p>
<p>In the past few years, several genome wide PPARγ binding profiles have been generated in adipocytes, using either ChIP-ChIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lefterova1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nakachi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Wakabayashi1">[21]</xref>, ChIPseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lefterova2">[22]</xref> or ChIP-PET technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Hamza1">[23]</xref>. These global approaches have provided important new concepts, like the extensive crosstalk between PPARγ and C/EBPα as deduced from the overlap in their cistromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lefterova1">[4]</xref>. The binding profiles have also given important information on the single gene level, i.e. the identification of novel PPARγ target genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (e.g. Agpat2 and Hk2, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>). Furthermore, genome wide binding profiles have helped to elucidate complex gene regulatory mechanisms, as exemplified by the genomic GPR81-GPR109A and UCP3-UCP2 regions, where single PPREs regulate multiple genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Jeninga1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Bugge1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Using the PPARγ-RXR ChIPseq profile by Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref> as a starting point, we identified the mouse chrondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1 gene (<italic>C4ST1/Chst11</italic>) as a novel target of PPARy. Chst11 is a Golgi-bound enzyme that catalyses the transfer of sulphate groups to the 4-O position of chondroitin sulphate (CS) and dermatan sulphate (DS). Membrane-bound sulphated proteoglycans are necessary for lipid accumulation in adipocytes, possibly because of their ability to interact with lipases like Lpl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Wilsie1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Misra1">[26]</xref>. We found Chst11 mRNA and protein expression to be upregulated by PPARy during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and identified two functional intronic PPARy binding sites in the Chst11 gene. In common with disruption of Lpl function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Gonzales1">[27]</xref>, siRNA-mediated knock down of Chst11 resulted in reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This effect is probably not due to inhibition of adipogenesis, as the expression of typical adipogenic genes such as <italic>C/EBPa</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Lpl</italic> and adiponectin (<italic>Adipoq</italic>) was unaffected. Rather, knockdown of Chst11 inhibited the activity of Lpl. These findings suggest that PPARy may regulate Lpl-mediated lipid accumulation by two different mechanisms: it increases <italic>Lpl</italic> transcription directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Schoonjans1">[13]</xref>, but can also indirectly regulate activity of the Lpl protein by elevating Chst11 expression and thereby increasing the number of docking sites for Lpl on the adipocyte cell surface.</p>

<title>Chst11 is a Novel PPARy Target Gene</title>
<p>To identify novel PPARy target genes we thoroughly analysed ChIPseq data generated by Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Nielsen1">[3]</xref>. We focused on loci that displayed PPARy/RXRα binding at day 6 with little or no binding of these transcription factors at day 0 of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Using these criteria we identified the carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 <italic>Chst11</italic>, also known as C4st1, as a potential direct PPARγ target gene. Chst11 can sulphate chondroitin sulphate-proteoglycans (CSPG), which plays an important role in development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Kluppel1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Kluppel2">[32]</xref>; see also Discussion).

As a positive control, primers located at the Fabp4 PPREs (∼5500 bp from transcription start site; light gray bars) were used, primers located in the globin locus were used as a negative control (white bars). Results are shown relative to normalized ChIP recovery data of day 0 and results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. (C and D) U2OS cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct (TKpGL3) containing Chst11 site 1 or site 2 sequences, or the parental reporter construct, together with empty (pCDNA) or PPARγ encoding expression vectors. Activation of the luciferase reporter in the absence or presence of 1 µM rosiglitazone is expressed as fold induction over that with empty reporter cotransfected with pCDNA in the absence of rosiglitazone after normalisation for Renilla luciferase activity.

<p>The recruitment of PPARγ to the two intronic binding sites in the Chst11 gene in mature adipocytes (day 6) was confirmed by ChIP-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). As a positive control the well-characterized PPARy/RXRα enhancer bindingsite in the Fabp4 gene was used. In addition, the recruitment in preadipocytes (day 0), in which PPARγ expression is low, was negligible and PPARγ was not detected on an arbitrary region of the beta-globin gene, which served as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Having established that PPARy is recruited to site 1 and 2 upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>), we wished to investigate whether these intronic binding sites could act as functional enhancers. Therefore, both regions were cloned in a promoter-containing reporter plasmid (TK-pGL3). The activity of these reporters was determined in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, which express negligible levels of endogenous PPARγ protein, but display a robust response upon overexpression of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Jeninga2">[29]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Figure 1C and D</xref>, transfection of cells with an expression vector encoding PPARγ2 activated the reporter genes containing PPARy/RXRα binding sites of the Chst11 gene compared to empty vector control (pCDNA), most markedly for binding site 1. Activation of PPARγ by the synthetic ligand rosiglitazone further enhanced the PPARγ-mediated activation of both reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1C and D</xref>), indicating that the two intronic PPARy/RXRα binding sites in the Chst11 gene can act as functional enhancers.</p>
<p>To corroborate these findings, we investigated whether modulation of endogenous PPARγ protein affected Chst11 expression. First, siRNA-mediated knock down of PPARγ was performed. PPARγ knock down resulted in a significant reduction of Chst11 mRNA expression in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of mature adipocytes with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone resulted in increased Chst11 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), while incubation with the antagonist GW9662 lowered Chst11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Taken together, these data classify Chst11 as a novel direct PPARγ target gene.</p>

<p>Next, we examined Chst11 mRNA and protein expression in adipogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Chst11 mRNA levels were found to increase 8 fold and reached its climax at day 2 of differentiation after which the levels were stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). As a control, expression of PPARγ was analysed, which increased steadily over the course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). To investigate Chst11 protein expression and localization, immunofluorescent staining of Chst11 was combined with fluorescent staining for intracellular lipid droplets (Nile red) to mark differentiated cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, mature adipocytes (Nile Red positive) also stained positive for Chst11 protein, while Chst11 could not be detected in preadipocytes (Nile Red negative). Chst11 displayed cytoplasmic localization in mature adipocytes, in agreement with other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Kluppel1">[31]</xref>. In summary, these data indicate that Chst11 is induced during adipogenesis, both at the mRNA and protein level.</p>

<title>Knockdown of Chst11 Leads to Decreased Intracellular Lipid Accumulation, but not Adipogenesis</title>
<p>Having established that PPARy regulates Chst11 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and that Chst11 is expressed on the mRNA and protein level in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we wished to investigate the role of Chst11 in adipocytes. To address this, siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed in 3T3-L1 cells, and cells were subsequently subjected to adipogenic culture conditions. siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced Chst11 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Chst11 knock down led to decreased lipid accumulation, as assessed by Oil-red-O staining of intracellular lipids, a phenomenon also observed upon Lpl knock down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Gonzales1">[27]</xref>. Reduced lipid staining may be the result of reduced adipogenesis or only reduced lipid accumulation. To distinguish between these possibilities the effect of Chst11 knock down on the expression of <italic>C/EBPα</italic> and <italic>PPARγ</italic>, two key regulators of adipogenesis, was examined. Only marginal differences were observed between cells that had been treated with Chst11 siRNA oligonucleotides or scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). PPARy protein levels were also not affected dramatically by Chst11 knockdown. Expression of the genes encoding Lpl, adiponectin (Adipoq) and FABP4, which are all up-regulated in adipogenesis, was also unaffected by Chst11 knock down. Knock down of PPARγ, which has repeatedly been reported to block adipogenesis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Rosen2">[8]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Koppen1">[34]</xref>), however significantly inhibited the expression of all these genes. These findings therefore indicate that Chst11 specifically regulates lipid accumulation rather than adipogenesis.</p>

<title>Knockdown of Chst11 Leads to Decreased Lpl Activity</title>
<p>Since Chst11 knock down reduced lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and given that Lpl is required for lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Gonzales1">[27]</xref> we hypothesized that Chst11 activity may regulate Lpl activity in mature adipocytes. In favour of this hypothesis is the finding that Lpl requires a stable negatively charged docking site on HSPGs for binding to the cell surface of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lookene1">[35]</xref>, which can be provided by Chst11-mediated sulfation of CS in adipocytes. To test this possibility, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and subjected to scrambled, PPARγ and Chst11 siRNA-mediated knock down, after which Lpl was released from the adipocyte cell surface by heparin treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Weinstein1">[36]</xref>, and enzymatic activity was determined as a measure for cell-surface-associated Lpl. Upon knock down of Chst11 a significant reduction in Lpl activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g004">Fig. 4</xref>; p&lt;0.05). As a control, knock down of PPARγ, which regulates the expression of both Chst11 (current study) and Lpl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Schoonjans1">[13]</xref>, was performed. As expected, reduced PPARγ expression also resulted in impaired Lpl activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064284-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). These data support a model in which PPARy regulates Chst11 expression, leading to increased sulphated CS chains which can then form docking sites for Lpl, ultimately contributing to lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple extracellular signalling pathways have been implicated in adipogenesis, ultimately leading to upregulation of the transcription factor PPARy, the master regulator of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Rosen3">[37]</xref>. PPARy directly regulates the expression of genes involved in various aspects of lipid handling, including Lpl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lehrke1">[38]</xref>. Here we have identified the enzyme Chst11, which harbours sulfotransferase activity, as a novel PPARγ target gene. Knockdown of Chst11 does not affect the adipogenic gene program, but rather inhibits lipid accumulation, possibly through inhibition of the cell surface binding of Lpl. These findings suggest that the central role of PPARy in lipid metabolism in adipocytes extends beyond the regulation of genes directly involved in lipid handling, and includes genes like Chst11, which play a more indirect role. Chst11 can sulphate the 4-O position of GalNac residues in chondroitin sulphate (CS), one of the major classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Yamauchi1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Hiraoka1">[40]</xref>. GAGs are sulphated repeating disaccharide units, which together with core proteins can form proteoglycans like heparan- and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG/CSPG), and function in cell-cell communication, adhesion, and protein presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Bishop1">[41]</xref>. In addition, CSPG/HSPG are necessary for lipid accumulation in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Wilsie1">[25]</xref>. Sulfation of GAGs by sulfotranferases like Chst11 adds negative charge to proteoglycans, which is important for interactions with various other proteins like growth factors, apolipoproteins, extracellular matrix, and plasma proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Bishop1">[41]</xref>. Importantly, sulphated and thus negatively charged HSPG can function as a docking site for Lpl in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Lookene1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Mead1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, macrophages produce an oversulfated CSPG that can also bind Lpl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Edwards1">[43]</xref>, and CSPG is the dominant proteoglycan on the adipocyte cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Wilsie1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Calvo1">[44]</xref>. When combined with our current data, these findings suggest that the main role of Chst11 in adipocytes may be to increase the amount of sulphated, negatively charged CS chains that could then act as binding sites for Lpl activity on the adipocyte cell surface. Additional experiments are required to establish the sulphation status of CSPG, and its role in Lpl binding in adipocytes.</p>
<p>Lpl is best known for its role in endothelium, where secreted Lpl travels through the capillary walls towards the luminal space of the endothelium, and binds to the proteoglycans that are anchored into vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Mead1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Saxena1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Obunike1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Goldberg1">[47]</xref>. The transport of Lpl from adipocytes and myocytes, which produce high Lpl levels, to the capillary walls has just recently been unravelled. The GPIHBP1 protein, which is present on both apical and basolateral surface of endothelial cells, is capable of transporting Lpl from basolateral to the apical surface of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Davies1">[48]</xref>. At the luminal side, Lpl can help to cleave lipids off chylomicrons and VLDL particles, so that the fatty acids can enter through the capillaries towards the adipocytes where it can be stored. Lpl molecules that are internalized by endothelial cells are recycled back to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Misra1">[26]</xref>. Although Lpl binds to the surface of adipocytes with 5–10 fold higher efficiency compared to endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Saxena2">[49]</xref>, its role in adipocytes is less well-defined. Multiple studies have provided evidence that lipolysis of lipoproteins at the endothelium by Lpl can loosen the junctions between endothelial cells so that large lipid enriched lipoproteins can pass through them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Saxena1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Rutledge1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Hennig1">[51]</xref>. In this event, Lpl should also be present at the cell surface of adipocytes to deplete the lipoproteins of their lipids. Surface-bound Lpl activity, which may be positively regulated by sulfotransferases like Chst11, can therefore be regarded as a back-up system for efficient take-up of lipids from lipoproteins. As genetic inactivation of Chst11 is associated with severe developmental abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0064284-Kluppel1">[31]</xref>, adipose tissue-specific Chst11 knock-out mice will need to be generated to establish the precise role for Chst11 in lipid accumulation in adipocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
