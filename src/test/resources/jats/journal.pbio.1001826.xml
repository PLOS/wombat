<title/>
<p>Closing the high seas to fishing could induce cooperation among countries and lead to global increases in fish stocks, harvest, and profit.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The world's oceans are governed as a system of over 150 sovereign exclusive economic zones (EEZs, ∼42% of the ocean) and one large high seas (HS) commons (∼58% of ocean) with essentially open access. Many high-valued fish species such as tuna, billfish, and shark migrate around these large oceanic regions, which as a consequence of competition across EEZs and a global race-to-fish on the HS, have been over-exploited and now return far less than their economic potential. We address this global challenge by analyzing with a spatial bioeconomic model the effects of completely closing the HS to fishing. This policy both induces cooperation among countries in the exploitation of migratory stocks and provides a refuge sufficiently large to recover and maintain these stocks at levels close to those that would maximize fisheries returns. We find that completely closing the HS to fishing would simultaneously give rise to large gains in fisheries profit (&gt;100%), fisheries yields (&gt;30%), and fish stock conservation (&gt;150%). We also find that changing EEZ size may benefit some fisheries; nonetheless, a complete closure of the HS still returns larger fishery and conservation outcomes than does a HS open to fishing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past 60 years have been a tumultuous period for the world's marine fisheries. In the early 1950s few stocks had been exploited heavily; but without explicit governance, large industrial fisheries took hold and systematically overexploited many stocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-CullisSuzuki1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Pauly1">[2]</xref>. In 1994 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) implemented Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) adjacent to all coastal nations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These property rights extend 200 nm (∼42% of the ocean) and allow countries to exclude foreign fleets and exclusively manage fisheries within their jurisdictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-UNCLOS1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hannesson1">[4]</xref>. Indeed, for countries with science-based fisheries management policies, many local stocks and fisheries contained in their EEZs are rebuilding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Pitcher1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Worm1">[7]</xref>. But for many pelagic, migratory stocks such as tuna, billfish, and shark, the size of the EEZs has been insufficient to incentivize sustainable fishing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-FAO1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Clarke1">[10]</xref>. Fish that traverse multiple EEZs and the high seas ([HS], ∼58% of ocean) are overexploited relative to those contained in a single EEZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-McWhinnie1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Bjorndal1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<p>This observation accords with two long-standing theoretical predictions: First, that open access tends to produce a “tragedy of the commons” (an unregulated state of affairs in which individuals inefficiently compete for a shared, limited resource, resulting in its eventual ruin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hardin1">[13]</xref>), where fishermen will race to fish, drive stocks down, and compete away economic value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Bjorndal1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Gordon1">[14]</xref>. Thus, we may expect HS stocks to be overexploited. Second, that spatial property rights, such as EEZs, will mediate overexploitation, but only to the extent that they enclose the full range of the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-White1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hannesson2">[16]</xref>. If fish migrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Block1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Block2">[18]</xref> and/or have dispersive larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Kinlan1">[19]</xref>, the ensuing spatial externality presents a competitive situation in which countries act like players in a non-cooperative game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Levhari1">[20]</xref>. Thus, we may expect that the more EEZs a stock traverses, the less likely a sustainable outcome. When put together, these theories suggest that migratory species pose perhaps the greatest global challenge to sustainable fisheries management <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Munro1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, all nations would cooperate in the management of transboundary stocks. Indeed for decades hundreds of attempts have been made at multi-lateral agreements primarily through regional fishery management organizations, which aim to coordinate fishing across EEZs and on the HS. While some exceptions exist, these efforts are widely regarded as a failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Bjorndal1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hannesson2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-FAO2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Pitcher2">[22]</xref>.</p>

<title>Modeling High Seas Closure</title>
<p>It is within this context that we analyze the alternative of a complete HS closure. While large marine protected areas (MPAs) in the HS are of increasing interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Game1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Corrigan1">[25]</xref>, a complete closure has not been proposed, and what little analysis exists suggests there would be substantial economic losses from such a policy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Sumaila1">[26]</xref>. Smaller MPAs, increasingly common and well-studied in coastal waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Gaines1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Lester1">[28]</xref>, are too small to produce significant benefits for most migratory stocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Sumaila1">[26]</xref>. Also, closing only a portion of the high seas may simply displace fishing effort to other open-access areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hilborn1">[29]</xref>, thereby leaving the problem unsolved. Instead, a complete closure of the HS may simultaneously achieve three desirable outcomes: (1) It acts as a coordination mechanism across EEZs; (2) it reduces overall exploitation rates; and (3) it protects a sufficient range of the stock to allow rebuilding.</p>
<p>The “risk” of closing the HS is that some species may not range sufficiently far into EEZs, leaving those stocks underexploited. Therefore, we also consider changing the size of the EEZs. A key aspect of our analysis involves modeling the behavioral competition between countries for stocks in EEZs and on the HS. To do so, we adopt a game theoretical perspective (for estimating the strategic decisions among interacting players in a competitive scenario), and use coupled biological-economic models in which stocks traverse multiple EEZs and the HS and the relevant players compete for fisheries profits. Thus, rather than making assumptions about exploitation rates we derive the likely behavioral adjustments under any given policy.</p>
<p>We model a large range of governance and biological scenarios that represent the range of conditions for pelagic, migratory species in the world's oceans. Any given scenario is defined by: (1) the fraction of the fish stock's range (and fishery) in EEZs (the remainder being on the HS); (2) the number of EEZs traversed by the stock; (3) the biological parameters of the stock; and (4) the degree of site fidelity of individual fish. For each scenario we evaluate three states of governance of the HS: open access (“HS open [OA]”), closed to fishing (“HS closed”), or competed for by <italic>N</italic> players (“HS open [<italic>N</italic>]”). We use a widely used cost function throughout. Our baseline model adopts conservative parameter values, stacking the deck against a HS closure. As a benchmark we also model the idealistic case of complete global cooperation across the entire range of the stock. Full methods are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s007">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We examined the effects of a HS closure first with a simple example. Suppose a reasonably fast-growing stock (<italic>r</italic> = 0.2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Myers1">[30]</xref> has high site-fidelity (<italic>S</italic> = 0.75), and is proportionally distributed across the HS (58%) and ten EEZs (42%). Our model predicted that when the HS were open, the ten countries would compete on both the HS and their EEZs, and drive stocks to a third of the economically optimal stock size. When the HS were closed, countries would compete across EEZs, but no fishing would occur on the HS: stock increased everywhere (4-fold on the HS and 30% in EEZs), profit more than doubled, and yield increased by 42% (though profit and yield are still only 68% and 84% of their theoretical values under complete cooperation). The disproportionate increase in profit is due to interacting effects of elimination of the inefficient overexploitation on the HS, enhanced coordination across EEZs incentivized by the spillover and protection of fish from the HS, and reduced fishery cost from harvesting a higher stock density in the EEZs. Collectively, these factors raise profit (and yield) beyond the loss from not fishing on the HS.</p>
<p>The figures plot various results against the fraction of the fishery contained in EEZs. When a fishery is mostly in EEZs, the problem boiled down to a transboundary one—where an international fish stock was not contained in any one country's jurisdiction. In that case, closing the HS did not, by itself, fix coordination problems across nations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s002">S2</xref>), because escaped stocks still could be harvested by a competing fishery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Munro1">[9]</xref>. Instead, if a fishery is primarily on the HS, closing the HS eliminated the fishery, generating a loss. For fisheries targeting pelagic, migratory stocks, typically some but not all of the fishery occurs in EEZs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-FAO1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Block1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Block2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Pauly2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Lehodey1">[32]</xref>. In those cases, closing the HS nearly always benefited the fishery: with our baseline parameters, if at least 10% of the fishery were contained in EEZs, then closing the HS increased fishery profits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s002">S2A</xref>). Across the full range of parameters, if at least 20% of the fishery were contained in EEZs, then closing the HS increased profit. The explanation is simple: most species harvested on the HS are vulnerable to overexploitation when the HS are fished, but are likely to recover (and benefit sovereign fisheries via spillover) when the HS are closed. As expected, profits and yields from a HS closure were never as large as levels achievable under complete global cooperation of harvest levels across the HS and EEZs (at best, they were on average ∼60% and ∼80% as high, occurring when ∼40% of the fishery is in EEZs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s001">S1</xref>). Regarding conservation, a HS closure always resulted in large increases in fish stocks (possibly by &gt;100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s002">S2C</xref>), consistent with the literature cataloging the conservation benefits of marine reserves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Lester1">[28]</xref> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hilborn1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Mora2">[33]</xref> for counter-examples, particularly in relation to cumulative impacts and management challenges in marine ecosystems).</p>

<p>The more EEZs traversed by the stock (<italic>N</italic>) the worse was the tragedy of the commons, and the greater was the percentage increase from a HS closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s003">S3</xref>). Under typical values of <italic>N</italic> (say, <italic>N</italic> = 10–20), the gain was considerable. If fish are evenly distributed between HS and EEZs, so 42% are enclosed in EEZs, then any <italic>N</italic>&gt;3 scenario provided benefits, and any <italic>N</italic>&gt;10 more than doubled the value of the fishery. In the extreme, for stocks that traverse 50 or more EEZs, the gains could exceed 500%. If the true <italic>N</italic> is large (say, <italic>N</italic> = 20), but nations cooperate, the effective <italic>N</italic> may be small (say, <italic>N</italic> = 5). Even in that case, a HS closure increased fishery profit. We assumed relatively high site fidelity (<italic>S</italic> = 0.75); results were strengthened under lower site fidelity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s004">Figure S4</xref>). All of the above results held over a large range of growth rates, though gains from HS closure were largest for slower-growing species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

<p>Holding a species' range constant, larger EEZs will increase the fraction of the fishery contained in EEZs (rightward shift in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s006">S6</xref>). Focusing on the blue and red shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001826-g002">Figure 2</xref>, except for narrow EEZs, closing the HS typically generated large gains for both profit and stock (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Further, when the HS are open, the worst possible EEZ width was around 40%—this width gave rise to the lowest profit and stock of any possible configuration of EEZs (on average, around 25% and 20% of what was possible for each). Thus the status quo (open HS and 42% in EEZs) was nearly the worst case scenario: the HS are heavily overexploited and countries' EEZs are too small to protect stocks from non-cooperative harvest. Why not simply extend the EEZs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Hannesson2">[16]</xref>? Doing so entailed a benefit, but as the EEZs enlarge, the source of overharvest changed from being primarily a HS problem to being primarily a transboundary problem. Rather, we have shown that completely closing the HS to fishing provided ample protection to the migratory stocks from transboundary overharvest, and without changing EEZ size still allowed each country sufficient space to harvest profitably in their EEZ.</p>

<title>From Modeling to Implementation</title>
<p>While our main finding is likely to hold across many, if not all, ocean basins, there inevitably will be distributional impacts. For example, the handful of countries whose current fishing fleets specialize in fishing the HS (e.g., Japan, China, and Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Pauly2">[31]</xref>) may be harmed by the closure. On the other hand, these countries' HS losses may be offset by enhanced fishing opportunities in their EEZs as stocks rebuild. Developing countries whose stocks are depleted by HS over-exploitation but who have not invested in HS fleets may benefit most from a HS closure. Thus, for a HS closure to be considered in practice, it will be important for future work to explore empirically the fishery and country-level distributional impacts of this proposal.</p>
<p>While a complete policy analysis is beyond our scope, a few comments are worth noting. Closing the HS to fishing may seem politically unviable, partly because UNCLOS recognizes the freedom to fish there by all nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-UNCLOS1">[3]</xref>. However, UNCLOS also requires ecosystem protection and equitable and efficient utilization of the ocean's resources. Thus, there is demand for a new legal instrument for HS governance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Ban1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-UNGA1">[35]</xref>; it could support a HS closure to meet the UNCLOS equity, economic, and conservation objectives. First, gains from a HS closure are attributable to fish spillover into EEZs, thus although not fishing in the HS, the freedom to fish resources from the HS is maintained. Second, the closure may only apply to mobile fishery species (and perhaps over-exploited by-catch species), and not sessile species (<italic>S</italic> = 1) where fishery value would be reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Third, a portion of the gains from closing the HS could be distributed among land-locked nations in a fashion similar to existing transfers for transboundary fisheries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Munro2">[36]</xref>. Finally, although perfect compliance with a HS closure may not be necessary for gains to emerge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001826.s006">Figure S6</xref>), enforcement is a concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-FAO1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Corrigan1">[25]</xref>. Yet major advances in fishery surveillance technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Game1">[23]</xref>, recent increases in the scope and use of agreements on the HS (including with MPAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-FAO1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Game1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Corrigan1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-OLeary1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001826-Gjerde1">[38]</xref>, and perhaps part of the fishery gains due to the HS closure, could be used to support its enforcement. Research on the viability of these options would contribute substantially to our understanding of the political and economic feasibility of closing the high seas.</p>
