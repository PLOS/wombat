Notably, the mortality rate of animals subjected to high doses of lipopolysaccharide is dependent on the time of treatment. In addition, the severity of symptoms of various inflammatory conditions follows a daily rhythmic pattern. The mechanisms behind the crosstalk between the circadian and immune systems remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that localized inflammation induced by turpentine oil (TURP) causes a time-dependent induction of interleukin (IL)-6 and has time-, gene- and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression. More precisely, TURP blunts the peak of <em>Per1</em> and <em>Per2</em> expression in the liver while in other tissues, the expression nadir is elevated. In contrast, <em>Rev-erbα</em> expression remains relatively unaffected by TURP treatment. Co-treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) did not alter the response of <em>Per2</em> to TURP treatment in liver, despite the reduced induction of fever and IL-6 serum levels. This indicates that the TURP-mediated changes of <em>Per2</em> in the liver might be due to factors other than systemic IL-6 and fever. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment had no effect on clock gene expression in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells. Altogether, we show that localized inflammation causes significant time-dependent changes in peripheral circadian clock gene expression, via a mechanism likely involving mediators independent from IL-6 and fever.</p>

<div id="section1" class="section toc-section"><a id="s1" name="s1" data-toc="s1" class="link-target" title="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Circadian clocks allow living organisms to adapt their internal biology to the 24 h day. Variations in environmental cues (or Zeitgebers) such as the light-dark cycle (LD), feeding times or socialization rhythms coordinate molecular circadian oscillations to daily cycles. Circadian clocks are endogenous to most cells in the body and their coordination is essential for internal homeostasis and health <a href="#pone.0059808-Dibner1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>. The master pacemaker resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus and is necessary for the synchronisation of circadian oscillators located in other brain regions and most peripheral tissues <a href="#pone.0059808-Dibner1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>. The central SCN clock elicits coordination of peripheral clocks through direct neuronal mechanisms <a href="#pone.0059808-Buijs1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Vujovic1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a> and humoral mechanisms <a href="#pone.0059808-Balsalobre1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Pando1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>. The molecular clock is composed of clock genes including <em>Clock, Bmal1, Cryptochromes (Cry)1</em> and <em>2</em>, <em>Periods (Per)1,</em> and <em>2</em> and the orphan nuclear receptors <em>Rev-erbα</em> and <em>Retinoid acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) α</em>. These clock genes are involved in self-sustaining transcriptional feedback loops that occur with a period of approximately 24 h <a href="#pone.0059808-Duguay1" class="ref-tip">[7]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>As is the case for various other regulatory systems, many aspects of the immune system show 24 h rhythms, including circulating cytokine levels and counts of various immune cell types <a href="#pone.0059808-Haus1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Born1" class="ref-tip">[9]</a>. In general, proinflammatory factors peak during the rest phase, which is the dark period in humans and the light period in nocturnal rodents <a href="#pone.0059808-Lange1" class="ref-tip">[10]</a>. Circadian rhythmicity of symptoms is common in inflammatory diseases <a href="#pone.0059808-Abad1" class="ref-tip">[11]</a>. For example, patients suffering from sepsis have the highest susceptibility to mortality in the early morning <a href="#pone.0059808-Hrushesky1" class="ref-tip">[12]</a>, while patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma or ankylosing spondylitis experience their worse symptoms early in the morning <a href="#pone.0059808-Cutolo1" class="ref-tip">[13]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Smolensky1" class="ref-tip">[15]</a>. In rodent models, treatment with the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during the rest period (light phase) invokes a substantially higher mortality risk compared to animals treated in the active period (dark phase), paralleling peak cytokine induction <a href="#pone.0059808-Halberg1" class="ref-tip">[16]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Marpegan1" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>In addition to this circadian control of inflammatory processes, inflammatory stimuli can impose changes in both central and peripheral circadian clocks. In humans, LPS administration suppresses clock gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes <a href="#pone.0059808-Haimovich1" class="ref-tip">[18]</a> Similarly, rodents treated with LPS show suppressed molecular rhythms in both central and peripheral clocks <a href="#pone.0059808-Okada1" class="ref-tip">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Yamamura1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a> and a phase shift of behavioural circadian rhythms <a href="#pone.0059808-Marpegan2" class="ref-tip">[21]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>Different inflammatory mediators were proposed to influence central and peripheral clocks <a href="#pone.0059808-Cavadini1" class="ref-tip">[22]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Ohdo1" class="ref-tip">[24]</a>, which could be responsible for the circadian disruptions following an endotoxin challenge. For instance, IL-6 was shown to stimulate <em>Per1</em> promoter activity in cultured cells <a href="#pone.0059808-Motzkus1" class="ref-tip">[25]</a>, but nothing is known on its effect on clock genes <em>in vivo</em>. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) time-dependently suppresses the expression of many clock genes both in cultured cells and <em>in vivo</em> <a href="#pone.0059808-Cavadini1" class="ref-tip">[22]</a> and suppresses melatonin in the pineal gland <a href="#pone.0059808-CarvalhoSousa1" class="ref-tip">[26]</a>. Finally, interferon alpha (IFNα) suppresses <em>Per1</em> in mouse liver and adrenal glands, but only with treatment during the active phase <a href="#pone.0059808-Ohdo1" class="ref-tip">[24]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>In this study, we address the effects of localized inflammation induced with turpentine oil (TURP) treatment on peripheral clock gene expression. An intramuscular TURP injection creates a sterile abscess and inflammation characterized by local synthesis of IL-1β and TNFα <a href="#pone.0059808-Luheshi1" class="ref-tip">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Zheng1" class="ref-tip">[28]</a>. These cytokines do not enter circulation, but induce the synthesis of IL-6, which then induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 gene transcription and prostaglandin (PG)E<sub>2</sub> production in the brain thermoregulatory centres, leading to fever development <a href="#pone.0059808-Zhang1" class="ref-tip">[29]</a>. Compared to LPS, TURP presents clear advantages to decipher the mechanism behind the effects of inflammation on circadian clocks. First, TURP elicits a simpler cytokine response, with IL-6 being the only circulating proinflammatory cytokine. Second, the slower time-course of TURP (6 h–10 h to reach maximal IL-6 levels and fever) compared to LPS (2 h–4 h) allows correlations to be made between inflammatory mediators and changes in clock gene expression. Using this strategy, we show that TURP elicits time-, tissue- and gene-specific effects on peripheral clock gene expression. Further, we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying these effects both <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> and found that despite the correlative peak changes of IL-6 with <em>Per</em> gene expression in the liver and heart, IL-6 does not seem to act directly to mediate these effects.</p>

<h3>Ethics Statement</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>All procedures with animals were approved by Douglas Institute Facility Animal Care Committee and McGill University Animal Care Committee, in line with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>
</div>

<h3>Animals</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old, weighing 250–300 g at the time of experiment; Charles River, Saint Constant, QC, Canada) were used in the experiments. The animals were housed individually in a controlled environment with a regular 12 h:12 h LD cycle (∼200 lux in the light periods) in an ambient temperature of 21±2°C. Regular chow and water were available <em>ad libitum</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3" class="section toc-section"><a id="s2c" name="s2c" class="link-target" title="Treatments"></a>
<h3>Treatments</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>In all experiments, animals were treated with either 0.1 mL of purified turpentine oil (TURP) (Riedel-deHaen, Sleeze, Germany) or 0.1 mL of sterile physiological saline by intramuscular (I.M.) injection into the right gastrocnemius muscle (hind-limb).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>In one experiment, animals were treated with human recombinant (hr) IL-1Ra (provided by Dr. Stephen Poole, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Hertfordshire, UK). Animals were treated intraperitoneally (I.P.) at a dose of 1 mg/kg at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after TURP treatment. The hrIL-1Ra was dissolved in physiological saline to a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and control animals were treated similarly with an equal volume of physiological saline.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>The times of treatment and sacrifice varied depending on the experiment. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation, blood was collected by trunk bleed into sterile tubes and serum was isolated by immediate centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. Aliquots were made and samples frozen at −80°C until use. Livers, hearts, kidneys and spleens were collected upon sacrifice, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>Analgesics were not used in our study, primarily because of the potential impact on some of our endpoint measures: Analgesics were shown to alter inflammatory responses and to affect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <a href="#pone.0059808-Lee1" class="ref-tip">[30]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Spinas1" class="ref-tip">[31]</a>. Moreover, analgesic treatment has impacts on circadian rhythms and on clock gene expression <a href="#pone.0059808-Hood1" class="ref-tip">[32]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Vansteensel1" class="ref-tip">[33]</a>. Additionally, the pain experienced by the rats upon injection of the dose of TURP used in our study (0.1 mL) is relatively minor, compared to the effects of the higher dose of 0.6 mL of TURP used in some of our previous studies <a href="#pone.0059808-Cooper1" class="ref-tip">[34]</a>, and the animals did not exhibit any outward signs of distress nor any pain-induced vocalization.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>All injections during the dark phase (ZT12-ZT0) were performed under dim red light. When animals were to be sacrificed during the dark phase, they were taken out of the room in a lightproof box and were not exposed to light until less than a minute before sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Temperature Recordings</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Temperature was monitored using remote radio-biotelemetry (Data Science International, St Paul, MN, USA) as previously described <a href="#pone.0059808-Sachot1" class="ref-tip">[35]</a>. Briefly, two weeks before the experiment, animals were abdominally implanted with pre-calibrated temperature-sensitive radio transmitters (TA10TA-F40, Data Sciences International) under isoflurane anaesthesia. Two days before the experiment, animals were placed on individual receiver boards containing an antenna to monitor the temperature output frequency (Hz) every 10 min until sacrifice. The temperature frequency was converted into degrees centigrade with Dataquest software (Data Sciences International). The baseline 24 h temperature fluctuation was established two days prior to treatment in each animal to ensure a normal diurnal profile.</p>

<h3><em>In vivo</em> Experiments</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Before each of the following three experiments, animals were habituated for 2 weeks in a 12 h:12 h LD cycle with daily handling at least one week before the experiment. This involved taking the animals out of their cages and manipulating them in the same way they would be at the time of injection (i.e., for handling prior to I.M. injection, animals held at the side of the experimenter and their rear gastrocnemious muscle revealed; prior to I.P. injections, animals wrapped in the same towel as for the injections and positioned such as to receive an injection).</p>

In all rat tissues, clock gene expression was assessed using SYBR Green quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Life Technologies, 7500 Real-Time PCR System). Primers for clock genes <em>Per1, Per2</em> and <em>Rev-erbα</em>, were designed using Primer3 software (sequences in <a href="#pone.0059808.s004">Table S1</a>).

<h3><em>In vivo</em> experiment 3: The Effects of anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra Treatment on TURP-Induced Changes of Clock Gene Expression</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>IL-1Ra is an anti-inflammatory cytokine upregulated following TURP treatment and is necessary to moderate the febrile response <a href="#pone.0059808-Fischer1" class="ref-tip">[46]</a>. IL-1Ra is a competitive antagonist of the IL-1 receptor <a href="#pone.0059808-Luheshi2" class="ref-tip">[36]</a> and consequently, it blocks IL-6 induction and fever in the TURP model by acting on IL-1 receptor at the site of localized inflammation <a href="#pone.0059808-Luheshi2" class="ref-tip">[36]</a>. The co-injection of hrIL-1Ra and TURP was used to assess the contribution of IL-6 to clock gene expression changes. At ZT2, animals were treated with either saline or TURP (I.M.) and in each group, the animals were also injected several times with either saline or hrIL-1Ra (I.P.). Two times of sacrifice were investigated based on the times of greatest change in Experiments 1 and 2: ZT12 and ZT16 TOS (10 h and 14 h after treatment, respectively). Altogether there were 4 groups per time point of sacrifice: saline-saline, saline-hrIL-1Ra, TURP-saline, and TURP-hrIL-1Ra.</p>

Post hoc tests revealed the expected fever induction upon TURP treatment alone (between the saline-saline and TURP-saline groups, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), starting 3.33 h after treatment. Co-treatment with IL-1Ra led to an attenuated fever induction (between the TURP-saline and TURP-IL-1Ra groups, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), a difference that was significant from 5.33 h after treatment, lasting until sacrifice. Under TURP-IL-1Ra co-treatment, temperature was still significantly elevated compared to the control without TURP (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001). Similarly, at ZT16 (<a href="#pone-0059808-g005">Fig. 5B</a>), there was a significant Time×Condition interaction (<em>F</em><sub>267,1237</sub> = 3.259, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). Here also, fever induction upon TURP treatment was significant (between the saline-saline and TURP-saline groups, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), a decrease of fever was observed upon co-treatment with IL-1Ra (between the TURP-saline and TURP-IL-1Ra groups, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), but to levels that were still significantly higher than controls without TURP (<em>p</em>&lt;0.001).</p>

<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>To assess the direct effect of IL-6 on clock gene expression in hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were treated with 0, 25 and 100 ng/mL of IL-6 and clock gene expression was assessed for up to 4 h after treatment. These IL-6 concentrations were previously shown in primary hepatocyte cells to elicit the an upregulation of the acute phase gene <em>CINC-1</em> in a similar magnitude as that induced during an inflammatory challenge <em>in vivo</em> <a href="#pone.0059808-Sheikh2" class="ref-tip">[47]</a>. As shown in <a href="#pone-0059808-g007">Fig. 7A–C</a>, there was no Time×Condition interaction for the expression of <em>Per1</em> (<em>F</em><sub>8,19</sub> = 1.56; <em>p</em>&gt;0.05), <em>Per2</em> (F<sub>8,19</sub> = 0.89; <em>p</em>&gt;0.05) or <em>Rev-erbα</em> (F<sub>8,19</sub> = 0.60; <em>p</em>&gt;0.05).

<div id="section4" class="section toc-section"><a id="s4" name="s4" data-toc="s4" class="link-target" title="Discussion"></a><h2>Discussion</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>We report that TURP-induced inflammation produces time-, gene-, and tissue-specific changes in clock gene expression in rat peripheral tissues. Interestingly, alterations in liver clock gene expression correlate with changes in IL-6 expression. However, by co-treatment with the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra, we show that systemic IL-6 does not seem to contribute to the suppression of <em>Per2</em> in the liver. Accordingly, the <em>in vitro</em> cell culture study also suggests that IL-6 does not act directly on liver cells to induce changes in clock gene expression.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Studies show that fever parallels IL-6 induction in the TURP model <a href="#pone.0059808-Luheshi1" class="ref-tip">[27]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Turnbull1" class="ref-tip">[50]</a>. This is indeed what we have observed when TURP treatment was done in the morning (<em>in vivo</em> experiment 1, <a href="#pone-0059808-g001">Fig. 1</a>). However, by comparing the outcome of treatment at different times of day (<em>in vivo</em> experiment 2, <a href="#pone-0059808-g002">Fig. 2</a>), we demonstrate that the serum concentration of IL-6 ten hours after TURP treatment is dependent on the time of injection. On the other hand, fever remains largely independent of TURP injection time (except the slight reduction upon sacrifice at ZT0). The magnitude of the systemic fever response was shown by others to be independent of the time of LPS treatment <a href="#pone.0059808-Severinsen1" class="ref-tip">[51]</a>, although the rise in temperature in the brain is dependent on this timing of treatment <a href="#pone.0059808-Mathias1" class="ref-tip">[52]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>A possible explanation for the time-dependent induction of IL-6 could lie in the balance of rhythmic humoral factors. One possibility is the balance of melatonin and glucocorticoids, rhythmic hormones that are immune-activating <a href="#pone.0059808-CarrilloVico1" class="ref-tip">[53]</a> and immune-suppressing <a href="#pone.0059808-Webster1" class="ref-tip">[54]</a>, respectively, which might be differentially regulated by the treatment at different times of day. Melatonin was also shown to act on LPS-induced intracellular signalling <a href="#pone.0059808-Tamura1" class="ref-tip">[55]</a>. Another possibility for the time-dependency of IL-6 response to TURP is a circadian regulation of cytokine secretion by immune cells upon stimulation by a pro-inflammatory agent, as was shown for the LPS treatment of macrophages <a href="#pone.0059808-Gibbs1" class="ref-tip">[56]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Narasimamurthy1" class="ref-tip">[58]</a> and the activation of splenocytes through toll-like receptor 9 <a href="#pone.0059808-Silver1" class="ref-tip">[59]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>We observed large TURP-mediated changes in clock genes expression that were time-, tissue- and gene-dependent (<a href="#pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</a> and <a href="#pone-0059808-g004">4</a>). <em>Per1</em> and <em>Per2</em> gene expression in the liver was downregulated at their normal peak (early dark phase) upon morning TURP treatment. In contrast, the effects on <em>Per</em> genes in other tissues were stronger when treatment occurred in the night, with an elevation of the expression nadir in the middle of the light phase. Effects on <em>Rev-erbα</em> mRNA levels were more subtle, but included a similar decrease of peak mRNA levels in the daytime after night-time treatment in the liver, kidney and spleen.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p5" name="article1.body1.sec4.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>LPS and TURP constitute different models of inflammation: LPS provokes a fast systemic inflammatory response while TURP induces a slower response to a localized inflammation. Despite these differences, clocks respond in a similar manner to both agents. Notably, <em>Per1</em>/<em>Per2</em> RNA levels at their peak expression in the early dark phase are blunted by LPS <a href="#pone.0059808-Okada1" class="ref-tip">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Yamamura1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a> and by TURP (<a href="#pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</a> and <a href="#pone-0059808-g004">4</a>) in the liver. In addition, both LPS and TURP invoke tissue-specific effects on peripheral clock genes <a href="#pone.0059808-Yamamura1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a> (<a href="#pone-0059808-g003">Figs 3</a> and <a href="#pone-0059808-g004">4</a>). However, the limited number of circulating mediators in TURP-induced inflammation and its slower time-course make this model superior to tease apart the mechanisms accounting for the effects. In this respect, in the liver and to a certain extent in the heart, the maximal change in IL-6 corresponds with the reduced peak of <em>Per</em> gene expression. This suggests that IL-6 may contribute to the changes in clock gene expression induced by TURP treatment.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p6" name="article1.body1.sec4.p6" class="link-target"></a><p>To test the influence of proinflammatory factors on clock gene expression in the TURP model, animals were treated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Ra. IL-1Ra blocks the binding of IL-1β to its receptor, thus effectively eliminating the upregulation of systemic IL-6 as IL-1β is required for the upregulation of IL-6 in the TURP model <a href="#pone.0059808-Zheng1" class="ref-tip">[28]</a>. Using this model, there was an expected attenuation of liver <em>Per2</em> expression in the TURP-treated groups sacrificed both 10 and 14 h after treatment (ZT12 and ZT16 TOS); however unexpectedly, <em>Per1</em> was not downregulated at either time point (<a href="#pone-0059808-g006">Fig. 6</a>). Experiment 1 demonstrated that the downregulation of <em>Per1</em> is transient (compared to the sustained downregulation of <em>Per2</em>), thus it is possible that our sampling missed the expected suppression of <em>Per1.</em> Considering <em>Per2</em> however, we observed that hrIL-1Ra treatment did not rescue the TURP-induced suppression despite the strong attenuation of IL-6 at sacrifice. This suggested that systemic IL-6 elevation did not induce the changes in liver clock gene expression.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p7" name="article1.body1.sec4.p7" class="link-target"></a><p>Previous studies have shown that TNFα, but not IL-6, suppresses clock gene expression in fibroblasts <a href="#pone.0059808-Cavadini1" class="ref-tip">[22]</a>. In another study, IL-6 used at a higher concentration downregulated <em>Per1</em> promoter activity in fibroblasts <a href="#pone.0059808-Motzkus1" class="ref-tip">[25]</a>. We determined that systemic IL-6 does not affect <em>Per2</em> expression in the liver, but it remains possible that a tissue-specific regulation of IL-6 could contribute to clock gene regulation. In one study, it was found that <em>IL-6</em> mRNA was upregulated in the muscle tissue where TURP was injected, but downregulated in the liver <a href="#pone.0059808-Sheikh1" class="ref-tip">[40]</a>. Also, IL-6 in the interstitial fluid of adipose tissue is 100 times higher than in the serum and acts as a potent paracrine signaling agent <a href="#pone.0059808-Sopasakis1" class="ref-tip">[60]</a>. Finally, it was shown that in response to LPS, IL-6 levels in spleen lymph were enriched compared to those in serum <a href="#pone.0059808-Semaeva1" class="ref-tip">[61]</a>. These local IL-6-enriched microenvironments could uniquely influence clock gene expression in particular tissues.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p8" name="article1.body1.sec4.p8" class="link-target"></a><p>The action of IL-6 could also depend on the differential expression of its receptor. IL-6 can act via IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which dimerizes with gp130 <a href="#pone.0059808-Taga1" class="ref-tip">[62]</a>, or by binding to the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), which then binds to gp130 <a href="#pone.0059808-Mitsuyama1" class="ref-tip">[63]</a>. Both cases initiate the JAK-STAT pathway. While only hepatocytes and some immune cells contain IL-6R <a href="#pone.0059808-Scheller1" class="ref-tip">[64]</a>, gp130 is ubiquitously expressed and can thus bind sIL-6R in various tissues <a href="#pone.0059808-Mitsuyama1" class="ref-tip">[63]</a>. It is possible that any of these proteins (IL-6R, gp130 or sIL-6R) are expressed rhythmically, thereby gating the response to IL-6 to induce different magnitudes of response depending on the time of day. To test whether IL-6 can act directly on the clock in liver cells, we treated liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) with IL-6 (<a href="#pone-0059808-g007">Fig. 7</a>). The absence of effect on clock genes in this assay suggests that IL-6 does not have a direct effect on clock gene expression in liver cells.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p9" name="article1.body1.sec4.p9" class="link-target"></a><p>Apart from IL-6, other humoral factors may impinge on the clock, as it has been shown that other cytokines can be upregulated in various tissues in the TURP model. Interferon(IFN)-γ and IFN-α treatment at ZT12 (but not ZT0) disturbs <em>Per</em> gene expression in both the liver and SCN <a href="#pone.0059808-Ohdo1" class="ref-tip">[24]</a>. TNFα was shown to suppress clock gene expression both in synchronized fibroblasts and in the liver <a href="#pone.0059808-Cavadini1" class="ref-tip">[22]</a>. Another proinflammatory factor, PGE<sub>2</sub>, was shown to have clock gene-modulating effects, inducing transient <em>Per1</em> expression in cultured fibroblasts and time-dependent circadian phase shifts in peripheral clocks <a href="#pone.0059808-Murphy1" class="ref-tip">[65]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Tsuchiya1" class="ref-tip">[66]</a>. Finally, leptin is an energy-regulating hormone that can act as a proinflammatory cytokine during a febrile response <a href="#pone.0059808-Luheshi3" class="ref-tip">[67]</a> and rises in response to inflammatory signals <a href="#pone.0059808-Sarraf1" class="ref-tip">[68]</a> including TURP <a href="#pone.0059808-AguilarValles1" class="ref-tip">[69]</a>. Interestingly, leptin treatment can alter the phase of the clock both centrally and peripherally <a href="#pone.0059808-Mendoza1" class="ref-tip">[70]</a>, and mice lacking functional leptin (<em>ob/ob</em> mice) exhibit disrupted clock gene expression in both adipose tissue and liver <a href="#pone.0059808-Ando1" class="ref-tip">[71]</a>. Given that leptin serum levels vary over the day and are controlled by the SCN central clock <a href="#pone.0059808-Kalsbeek1" class="ref-tip">[72]</a>, this hormone could possibly gate the response to inflammatory signals, thus imposing a time-dependent regulation on clock gene expression.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p10" name="article1.body1.sec4.p10" class="link-target"></a><p>In addition to humoral factors, neuronal connections and systemic cues such as body temperature or pain might mediate the effects of TURP on clock genes. To our knowledge, there are no reports of an effect of pain on clock genes. Moreover, the levels of pain in our TURP inflammation model is very low compared to established models of pain, which makes it an unlikely mediator for the strong effects we see in clock gene expression. Cycles of temperature changes are thought to participate in circadian gene expression in the periphery <a href="#pone.0059808-Brown1" class="ref-tip">[73]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Saini1" class="ref-tip">[75]</a>, with a mechanism that involves the heat-sensing transcription factor Heat Shock Factor 1 <a href="#pone.0059808-Buhr1" class="ref-tip">[74]</a>–<a href="#pone.0059808-Tamaru1" class="ref-tip">[76]</a> and the cold-sensing factor Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein <a href="#pone.0059808-Morf1" class="ref-tip">[77]</a>. In fact, <em>Per2</em> itself has HSF1 binding sites in its promoter <a href="#pone.0059808-Tamaru1" class="ref-tip">[76]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Kornmann1" class="ref-tip">[78]</a>. However, while fever induction is relatively independent of the time of injection, clock gene expression changes are injection time-dependent (<a href="#pone-0059808-g002">Figs 2</a> and <a href="#pone-0059808-g004">4</a>). Furthermore, our data showed that <em>Per2</em> mRNA repression by TURP treatment was unchanged even when IL-1Ra co-treatment strongly reduced fever (<a href="#pone-0059808-g005">Figs 5A, B</a> and <a href="#pone-0059808-g006">6</a>). Therefore, although we cannot exclude that the remaining fever following co-treatment with IL-1Ra might still be sufficient to affect clock genes, we believe that temperature is an unlikely mediator for the clock gene expression changes we have observed in the liver. Regarding a possible neuronal influence, sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways are likely to be involved in the entrainment of peripheral circadian clocks as there are many neuronal connections from the SCN to peripheral tissues including the liver, kidney, heart, muscle and spleen <a href="#pone.0059808-Buijs1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Maier1" class="ref-tip">[79]</a>. For example, <em>Per1</em> gene expression is quickly induced in the adrenal glands upon light stimulation, an induction that is lost in animals with adrenal denervation <a href="#pone.0059808-Ishida1" class="ref-tip">[80]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p11" name="article1.body1.sec4.p11" class="link-target"></a><p>It was found that the clocks in different tissues have different sensitivities to humoral cues and it is likely that balance of neuronal and humoral cues together coordinate tissue-specificity in peripheral clock entrainment <a href="#pone.0059808-Vujovic1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0059808-Guo1" class="ref-tip">[5]</a>. In particular, it was previously shown that the liver and kidney seem to be more sensitive to humoral cues, whereas the heart, spleen and muscle require other input – probably neuronal – to fully entrain their clocks <a href="#pone.0059808-Guo1" class="ref-tip">[5]</a>. Such differences in the response of tissues to different types of cues might contribute to the tissue-specific response to TURP that we have observed.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p12" name="article1.body1.sec4.p12" class="link-target"></a><p>Here, we have found that TURP-mediated inflammation induces time-, tissue- and gene-specific effects in peripheral circadian clocks. This localized inflammation model will help to identify the mediators underlying the impact of inflammation on circadian rhythms. Characterizing the changes in peripheral clock gene expression upon inflammation is essential to decipher the mechanisms behind time-dependent susceptibilities to inflammatory responses.</p>
